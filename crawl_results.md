# The Python Language Reference[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#the-python-language-reference "Link to this heading")
This reference manual describes the syntax and “core semantics” of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). For an informal introduction to the language, see [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index). For C or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist: [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#extending-index) describes the high-level picture of how to write a Python extension module, and the [Python/C API Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html#c-api-index) describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail.

# The Python Tutorial[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#the-python-tutorial "Link to this heading")
Tip
This tutorial is designed for _programmers_ that are new to the Python language, **not** _beginners_ who are new to programming.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, <https://www.python.org/>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. Be aware that it expects you to have a basic understanding of programming in general. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
For a description of standard objects and modules, see [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index) gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#extending-index) and [Python/C API Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html#c-api-index). There are also several books covering Python in depth.
This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index).
The [Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#glossary) is also worth going through.

#  8. Compound statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#compound-statements "Link to this heading")
Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.
The [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if), [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) and [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statements implement traditional control flow constructs. [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements, while the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization code around a block of code. Function and class definitions are also syntactically compound statements.
A compound statement consists of one or more ‘clauses.’ A clause consists of a header and a ‘suite.’ The clause headers of a particular compound statement are all at the same indentation level. Each clause header begins with a uniquely identifying keyword and ends with a colon. A suite is a group of statements controlled by a clause. A suite can be one or more semicolon-separated simple statements on the same line as the header, following the header’s colon, or it can be one or more indented statements on subsequent lines. Only the latter form of a suite can contain nested compound statements; the following is illegal, mostly because it wouldn’t be clear to which [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) clause a following [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else) clause would belong:
Copy```
if test1: if test2: print(x)

```

Also note that the semicolon binds tighter than the colon in this context, so that in the following example, either all or none of the [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print") calls are executed:
Copy```
if x < y < z: print(x); print(y); print(z)

```

Summarizing:
```
**compound_stmt** ::= [if_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-if_stmt)

                  | [async_for_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-async_for_stmt)
                  | [async_funcdef](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-async_funcdef)
**suite**         ::= [stmt_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stmt_list) NEWLINE | NEWLINE INDENT [statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-statement)+ DEDENT
**statement**     ::= [stmt_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stmt_list) NEWLINE | [compound_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-compound_stmt)
**stmt_list**     ::= [simple_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-simple_stmt) (";" [simple_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-simple_stmt))* [";"]

```

Note that statements always end in a `NEWLINE` possibly followed by a `DEDENT`. Also note that optional continuation clauses always begin with a keyword that cannot start a statement, thus there are no ambiguities (the ‘dangling [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else)’ problem is solved in Python by requiring nested [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statements to be indented).
The formatting of the grammar rules in the following sections places each clause on a separate line for clarity.
##  8.1. The `if` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement "Link to this heading")
The [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement is used for conditional execution:
```
**if_stmt** ::= "if" [assignment_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
            ("elif" [assignment_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite))*
            ["else" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]

```

It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one until one is found to be true (see section [Boolean operations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#booleans) for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed (and no other part of the [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement is executed or evaluated). If all expressions are false, the suite of the [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else) clause, if present, is executed.
##  8.2. The `while` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement "Link to this heading")
The [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true:
```
**while_stmt** ::= "while" [assignment_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
               ["else" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]

```

This repeatedly tests the expression and, if it is true, executes the first suite; if the expression is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the suite of the `else` clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.
A [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the `else` clause’s suite. A [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and goes back to testing the expression.
##  8.3. The `for` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement "Link to this heading")
The [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:
```
**for_stmt** ::= "for" [target_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target_list) "in" starred_list ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
             ["else" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]

```

The `starred_list` expression is evaluated once; it should yield an [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) object. An [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator) is created for that iterable. The first item provided by the iterator is then assigned to the target list using the standard rules for assignments (see [Assignment statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment)), and the suite is executed. This repeats for each item provided by the iterator. When the iterator is exhausted, the suite in the `else` clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.
A [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the `else` clause’s suite. A [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and continues with the next item, or with the `else` clause if there is no next item.
The for-loop makes assignments to the variables in the target list. This overwrites all previous assignments to those variables including those made in the suite of the for-loop:
Copy```
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    i = 5             # this will not affect the for-loop
                      # because i will be overwritten with the next
                      # index in the range

```

Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished, but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at all by the loop. Hint: the built-in type [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") represents immutable arithmetic sequences of integers. For instance, iterating `range(3)` successively yields 0, 1, and then 2.
Changed in version 3.11: Starred elements are now allowed in the expression list.
##  8.4. The `try` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement "Link to this heading")
The `try` statement specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements:
```
**try_stmt**  ::= [try1_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-try1_stmt) | [try2_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-try2_stmt) | [try3_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-try3_stmt)
**try1_stmt** ::= "try" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
              ("except" [[expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)]] ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite))+
              ["else" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]
              ["finally" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]
**try2_stmt** ::= "try" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
              ("except" "*" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)] ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite))+
              ["else" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]
              ["finally" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)]
**try3_stmt** ::= "try" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
              "finally" ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)

```

Additional information on exceptions can be found in section [Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#exceptions), and information on using the [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) statement to generate exceptions may be found in section [The raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise).
###  8.4.1. `except` clause[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-clause "Link to this heading")
The `except` clause(s) specify one or more exception handlers. When no exception occurs in the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) clause, no exception handler is executed. When an exception occurs in the `try` suite, a search for an exception handler is started. This search inspects the `except` clauses in turn until one is found that matches the exception. An expression-less `except` clause, if present, must be last; it matches any exception.
For an `except` clause with an expression, the expression must evaluate to an exception type or a tuple of exception types. The raised exception matches an `except` clause whose expression evaluates to the class or a [non-virtual base class](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class) of the exception object, or to a tuple that contains such a class.
If no `except` clause matches the exception, the search for an exception handler continues in the surrounding code and on the invocation stack. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#id20)
If the evaluation of an expression in the header of an `except` clause raises an exception, the original search for a handler is canceled and a search starts for the new exception in the surrounding code and on the call stack (it is treated as if the entire [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement raised the exception).
When a matching `except` clause is found, the exception is assigned to the target specified after the `as` keyword in that `except` clause, if present, and the `except` clause’s suite is executed. All `except` clauses must have an executable block. When the end of this block is reached, execution continues normally after the entire [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement. (This means that if two nested handlers exist for the same exception, and the exception occurs in the `try` clause of the inner handler, the outer handler will not handle the exception.)
When an exception has been assigned using `as target`, it is cleared at the end of the `except` clause. This is as if
Copy```
except E as N:
    foo

```

was translated to
Copy```
except E as N:
    try:
        foo
    finally:
        del N

```

This means the exception must be assigned to a different name to be able to refer to it after the `except` clause. Exceptions are cleared because with the traceback attached to them, they form a reference cycle with the stack frame, keeping all locals in that frame alive until the next garbage collection occurs.
Before an `except` clause’s suite is executed, the exception is stored in the [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") module, where it can be accessed from within the body of the `except` clause by calling [`sys.exception()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exception "sys.exception"). When leaving an exception handler, the exception stored in the [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") module is reset to its previous value:
Copy```
>>> print(sys.exception())
None
>>> try:
...     raise TypeError
... except:
...     print(repr(sys.exception()))
...     try:
...          raise ValueError
...     except:
...         print(repr(sys.exception()))
...     print(repr(sys.exception()))
...
TypeError()
ValueError()
TypeError()
>>> print(sys.exception())
None

```

###  8.4.2. `except*` clause[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star "Link to this heading")
The `except*` clause(s) specify one or more handlers for groups of exceptions ([`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup") instances). A [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement can have either [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) or `except*` clauses, but not both. The exception type for matching is mandatory in the case of `except*`, so `except*:` is a syntax error. The type is interpreted as in the case of `except`, but matching is performed on the exceptions contained in the group that is being handled. An [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised if a matching type is a subclass of `BaseExceptionGroup`, because that would have ambiguous semantics.
When an exception group is raised in the try block, each `except*` clause splits (see [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.split "BaseExceptionGroup.split")) it into the subgroups of matching and non-matching exceptions. If the matching subgroup is not empty, it becomes the handled exception (the value returned from [`sys.exception()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exception "sys.exception")) and assigned to the target of the `except*` clause (if there is one). Then, the body of the `except*` clause executes. If the non-matching subgroup is not empty, it is processed by the next `except*` in the same manner. This continues until all exceptions in the group have been matched, or the last `except*` clause has run.
After all `except*` clauses execute, the group of unhandled exceptions is merged with any exceptions that were raised or re-raised from within `except*` clauses. This merged exception group propagates on.:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     raise ExceptionGroup("eg",
...         [ValueError(1), TypeError(2), OSError(3), OSError(4)])
... except* TypeError as e:
...     print(f'caught {type(e)} with nested {e.exceptions}')
... except* OSError as e:
...     print(f'caught {type(e)} with nested {e.exceptions}')
...
caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'> with nested (TypeError(2),)
caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'> with nested (OSError(3), OSError(4))
  + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last):
  |   File "<doctest default[0]>", line 2, in <module>
  |     raise ExceptionGroup("eg",
  |         [ValueError(1), TypeError(2), OSError(3), OSError(4)])
  | ExceptionGroup: eg (1 sub-exception)
  +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | ValueError: 1
    +------------------------------------

```

If the exception raised from the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) block is not an exception group and its type matches one of the `except*` clauses, it is caught and wrapped by an exception group with an empty message string. This ensures that the type of the target `e` is consistently [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup"):
Copy```
>>> try:
...     raise BlockingIOError
... except* BlockingIOError as e:
...     print(repr(e))
...
ExceptionGroup('', (BlockingIOError()))

```

[`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) and [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) cannot appear in an `except*` clause.
###  8.4.3. `else` clause[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else-clause "Link to this heading")
The optional `else` clause is executed if the control flow leaves the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) suite, no exception was raised, and no [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return), [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue), or [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) statement was executed. Exceptions in the `else` clause are not handled by the preceding [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clauses.
###  8.4.4. `finally` clause[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally-clause "Link to this heading")
If `finally` is present, it specifies a ‘cleanup’ handler. The [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) clause is executed, including any [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) and [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-else) clauses. If an exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the exception is temporarily saved. The `finally` clause is executed. If there is a saved exception it is re-raised at the end of the `finally` clause. If the `finally` clause raises another exception, the saved exception is set as the context of the new exception. If the `finally` clause executes a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return), [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) or [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement, the saved exception is discarded:
Copy```
>>> deff():
...     try:
...         1/0
...     finally:
...         return 42
...
>>> f()
42

```

The exception information is not available to the program during execution of the `finally` clause.
When a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return), [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) or [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement is executed in the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) suite of a `try`…`finally` statement, the `finally` clause is also executed ‘on the way out.’
The return value of a function is determined by the last [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement executed. Since the `finally` clause always executes, a `return` statement executed in the `finally` clause will always be the last one executed:
Copy```
>>> deffoo():
...     try:
...         return 'try'
...     finally:
...         return 'finally'
...
>>> foo()
'finally'

```

Changed in version 3.8: Prior to Python 3.8, a [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement was illegal in the `finally` clause due to a problem with the implementation.
##  8.5. The `with` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement "Link to this heading")
The [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager (see section [With Statement Context Managers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers)). This allows common [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)…[`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except)…[`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) usage patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.
```
**with_stmt**          ::= "with" ( "(" [with_stmt_contents](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-with_stmt_contents) ","? ")" | [with_stmt_contents](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-with_stmt_contents) ) ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
**with_stmt_contents** ::= [with_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-with_item) ("," [with_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-with_item))*
**with_item**          ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ["as" [target](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target)]

```

The execution of the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement with one “item” proceeds as follows:
  1. The context expression (the expression given in the [`with_item`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-with_item)) is evaluated to obtain a context manager.
  2. The context manager’s [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") is loaded for later use.
  3. The context manager’s [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") is loaded for later use.
  4. The context manager’s [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method is invoked.
  5. If a target was included in the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement, the return value from [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") is assigned to it.
Note
The [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement guarantees that if the [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method returns without an error, then [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") will always be called. Thus, if an error occurs during the assignment to the target list, it will be treated the same as an error occurring within the suite would be. See step 7 below.
  6. The suite is executed.
  7. The context manager’s [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method is invoked. If an exception caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and traceback are passed as arguments to [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__"). Otherwise, three [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") arguments are supplied.
If the suite was exited due to an exception, and the return value from the [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method was false, the exception is reraised. If the return value was true, the exception is suppressed, and execution continues with the statement following the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.
If the suite was exited for any reason other than an exception, the return value from [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") is ignored, and execution proceeds at the normal location for the kind of exit that was taken.


The following code:
Copy```
with EXPRESSION as TARGET:
    SUITE

```

is semantically equivalent to:
Copy```
manager = (EXPRESSION)
enter = type(manager).__enter__
exit = type(manager).__exit__
value = enter(manager)
hit_except = False

try:
    TARGET = value
    SUITE
except:
    hit_except = True
    if not exit(manager, *sys.exc_info()):
        raise
finally:
    if not hit_except:
        exit(manager, None, None, None)

```

With more than one item, the context managers are processed as if multiple [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements were nested:
Copy```
with A() as a, B() as b:
    SUITE

```

is semantically equivalent to:
Copy```
with A() as a:
    with B() as b:
        SUITE

```

You can also write multi-item context managers in multiple lines if the items are surrounded by parentheses. For example:
Copy```
with (
    A() as a,
    B() as b,
):
    SUITE

```

Changed in version 3.1: Support for multiple context expressions.
Changed in version 3.10: Support for using grouping parentheses to break the statement in multiple lines.

##  8.6. The `match` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-match-statement "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.10.
The match statement is used for pattern matching. Syntax:
```
**match_stmt**   ::= 'match' [subject_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-subject_expr) ":" NEWLINE INDENT [case_block](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-case_block)+ DEDENT
**subject_expr** ::= star_named_expression "," star_named_expressions?
                 | named_expression
**case_block**   ::= 'case' [patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-patterns) [[guard](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-guard)] ":" block

```

Note
This section uses single quotes to denote [soft keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords).
Pattern matching takes a pattern as input (following `case`) and a subject value (following `match`). The pattern (which may contain subpatterns) is matched against the subject value. The outcomes are:
  * A match success or failure (also termed a pattern success or failure).
  * Possible binding of matched values to a name. The prerequisites for this are further discussed below.


The `match` and `case` keywords are [soft keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords).

  * [**PEP 634**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Specification
  * [**PEP 636**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Tutorial


###  8.6.1. Overview[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#overview "Link to this heading")
Here’s an overview of the logical flow of a match statement:
  1. The subject expression `subject_expr` is evaluated and a resulting subject value obtained. If the subject expression contains a comma, a tuple is constructed using [the standard rules](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-tuple).
  2. Each pattern in a `case_block` is attempted to match with the subject value. The specific rules for success or failure are described below. The match attempt can also bind some or all of the standalone names within the pattern. The precise pattern binding rules vary per pattern type and are specified below. **Name bindings made during a successful pattern match outlive the executed block and can be used after the match statement**.
Note
During failed pattern matches, some subpatterns may succeed. Do not rely on bindings being made for a failed match. Conversely, do not rely on variables remaining unchanged after a failed match. The exact behavior is dependent on implementation and may vary. This is an intentional decision made to allow different implementations to add optimizations.
  3. If the pattern succeeds, the corresponding guard (if present) is evaluated. In this case all name bindings are guaranteed to have happened.
     * If the guard evaluates as true or is missing, the `block` inside `case_block` is executed.
     * Otherwise, the next `case_block` is attempted as described above.
     * If there are no further case blocks, the match statement is completed.


Note
Users should generally never rely on a pattern being evaluated. Depending on implementation, the interpreter may cache values or use other optimizations which skip repeated evaluations.
A sample match statement:
Copy```
>>> flag = False
>>> match (100, 200):
...    case (100, 300):  # Mismatch: 200 != 300
...        print('Case 1')
...    case (100, 200) if flag:  # Successful match, but guard fails
...        print('Case 2')
...    case (100, y):  # Matches and binds y to 200
...        print(f'Case 3, y: {y}')
...    case_:  # Pattern not attempted
...        print('Case 4, I match anything!')
...
Case 3, y: 200

```

In this case, `if flag` is a guard. Read more about that in the next section.
###  8.6.2. Guards[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#guards "Link to this heading")
```
**guard** ::= "if" named_expression

```

A `guard` (which is part of the `case`) must succeed for code inside the `case` block to execute. It takes the form: [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) followed by an expression.
The logical flow of a `case` block with a `guard` follows:
  1. Check that the pattern in the `case` block succeeded. If the pattern failed, the `guard` is not evaluated and the next `case` block is checked.
  2. If the pattern succeeded, evaluate the `guard`.
     * If the `guard` condition evaluates as true, the case block is selected.
     * If the `guard` condition evaluates as false, the case block is not selected.
     * If the `guard` raises an exception during evaluation, the exception bubbles up.


Guards are allowed to have side effects as they are expressions. Guard evaluation must proceed from the first to the last case block, one at a time, skipping case blocks whose pattern(s) don’t all succeed. (I.e., guard evaluation must happen in order.) Guard evaluation must stop once a case block is selected.
###  8.6.3. Irrefutable Case Blocks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#irrefutable-case-blocks "Link to this heading")
An irrefutable case block is a match-all case block. A match statement may have at most one irrefutable case block, and it must be last.
A case block is considered irrefutable if it has no guard and its pattern is irrefutable. A pattern is considered irrefutable if we can prove from its syntax alone that it will always succeed. Only the following patterns are irrefutable:
  * [AS Patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#as-patterns) whose left-hand side is irrefutable
  * [OR Patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#or-patterns) containing at least one irrefutable pattern
  * [Capture Patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#capture-patterns)
  * [Wildcard Patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#wildcard-patterns)
  * parenthesized irrefutable patterns


###  8.6.4. Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#patterns "Link to this heading")
Note
This section uses grammar notations beyond standard EBNF:
  * the notation `SEP.RULE+` is shorthand for `RULE (SEP RULE)*`
  * the notation `!RULE` is shorthand for a negative lookahead assertion


The top-level syntax for `patterns` is:
```
**patterns**       ::= [open_sequence_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-open_sequence_pattern) | [pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern)
**pattern**        ::= [as_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-as_pattern) | [or_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_pattern)
**closed_pattern** ::= | [literal_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-literal_pattern)
                   | [capture_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-capture_pattern)
                   | [wildcard_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-wildcard_pattern)
                   | [value_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-value_pattern)
                   | [group_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-group_pattern)
                   | [sequence_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-sequence_pattern)
                   | [mapping_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-mapping_pattern)
                   | [class_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-class_pattern)

```

The descriptions below will include a description “in simple terms” of what a pattern does for illustration purposes (credits to Raymond Hettinger for a document that inspired most of the descriptions). Note that these descriptions are purely for illustration purposes and **may not** reflect the underlying implementation. Furthermore, they do not cover all valid forms.
####  8.6.4.1. OR Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#or-patterns "Link to this heading")
An OR pattern is two or more patterns separated by vertical bars `|`. Syntax:
```
**or_pattern** ::= "|".[closed_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-closed_pattern)+

```

Only the final subpattern may be [irrefutable](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#irrefutable-case), and each subpattern must bind the same set of names to avoid ambiguity.
An OR pattern matches each of its subpatterns in turn to the subject value, until one succeeds. The OR pattern is then considered successful. Otherwise, if none of the subpatterns succeed, the OR pattern fails.
In simple terms, `P1 | P2 | ...` will try to match `P1`, if it fails it will try to match `P2`, succeeding immediately if any succeeds, failing otherwise.
####  8.6.4.2. AS Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#as-patterns "Link to this heading")
An AS pattern matches an OR pattern on the left of the [`as`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#as) keyword against a subject. Syntax:
```
**as_pattern** ::= [or_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_pattern) "as" [capture_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-capture_pattern)

```

If the OR pattern fails, the AS pattern fails. Otherwise, the AS pattern binds the subject to the name on the right of the as keyword and succeeds. `capture_pattern` cannot be a `_`.
In simple terms `P as NAME` will match with `P`, and on success it will set `NAME = <subject>`.
####  8.6.4.3. Literal Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#literal-patterns "Link to this heading")
A literal pattern corresponds to most [literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals) in Python. Syntax:
```
**literal_pattern** ::= [signed_number](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-signed_number)
                    | [signed_number](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-signed_number) "+" NUMBER
                    | [signed_number](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-signed_number) "-" NUMBER
                    | strings
                    | "None"
                    | "True"
                    | "False"
**signed_number**   ::= ["-"] NUMBER

```

The rule `strings` and the token `NUMBER` are defined in the [standard Python grammar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html). Triple-quoted strings are supported. Raw strings and byte strings are supported. [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) are not supported.
The forms `signed_number '+' NUMBER` and `signed_number '-' NUMBER` are for expressing [complex numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#imaginary); they require a real number on the left and an imaginary number on the right. E.g. `3 + 4j`.
In simple terms, `LITERAL` will succeed only if `<subject> == LITERAL`. For the singletons `None`, `True` and `False`, the [`is`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is) operator is used.
####  8.6.4.4. Capture Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#capture-patterns "Link to this heading")
A capture pattern binds the subject value to a name. Syntax:
```
**capture_pattern** ::= !'_' NAME

```

A single underscore `_` is not a capture pattern (this is what `!'_'` expresses). It is instead treated as a [`wildcard_pattern`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-wildcard_pattern).
In a given pattern, a given name can only be bound once. E.g. `case x, x: ...` is invalid while `case [x] | x: ...` is allowed.
Capture patterns always succeed. The binding follows scoping rules established by the assignment expression operator in [**PEP 572**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/); the name becomes a local variable in the closest containing function scope unless there’s an applicable [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) or [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement.
In simple terms `NAME` will always succeed and it will set `NAME = <subject>`.
####  8.6.4.5. Wildcard Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#wildcard-patterns "Link to this heading")
A wildcard pattern always succeeds (matches anything) and binds no name. Syntax:
```
**wildcard_pattern** ::= '_'

```

`_` is a [soft keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords) within any pattern, but only within patterns. It is an identifier, as usual, even within `match` subject expressions, `guard`s, and `case` blocks.
In simple terms, `_` will always succeed.
####  8.6.4.6. Value Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#value-patterns "Link to this heading")
A value pattern represents a named value in Python. Syntax:
```
**value_pattern** ::= [attr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-attr)
**attr**          ::= [name_or_attr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-name_or_attr) "." NAME
**name_or_attr**  ::= [attr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-attr) | NAME

```

The dotted name in the pattern is looked up using standard Python [name resolution rules](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#resolve-names). The pattern succeeds if the value found compares equal to the subject value (using the `==` equality operator).
In simple terms `NAME1.NAME2` will succeed only if `<subject> == NAME1.NAME2`
Note
If the same value occurs multiple times in the same match statement, the interpreter may cache the first value found and reuse it rather than repeat the same lookup. This cache is strictly tied to a given execution of a given match statement.
####  8.6.4.7. Group Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#group-patterns "Link to this heading")
A group pattern allows users to add parentheses around patterns to emphasize the intended grouping. Otherwise, it has no additional syntax. Syntax:
```
**group_pattern** ::= "(" [pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern) ")"

```

In simple terms `(P)` has the same effect as `P`.
####  8.6.4.8. Sequence Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#sequence-patterns "Link to this heading")
A sequence pattern contains several subpatterns to be matched against sequence elements. The syntax is similar to the unpacking of a list or tuple.
```
**sequence_pattern**       ::= "[" [[maybe_sequence_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-maybe_sequence_pattern)] "]"
                           | "(" [[open_sequence_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-open_sequence_pattern)] ")"
**open_sequence_pattern**  ::= [maybe_star_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-maybe_star_pattern) "," [[maybe_sequence_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-maybe_sequence_pattern)]
**maybe_sequence_pattern** ::= ",".[maybe_star_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-maybe_star_pattern)+ ","?
**maybe_star_pattern**     ::= [star_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-star_pattern) | [pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern)
**star_pattern**           ::= "*" ([capture_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-capture_pattern) | [wildcard_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-wildcard_pattern))

```

There is no difference if parentheses or square brackets are used for sequence patterns (i.e. `(...)` vs `[...]` ).
Note
A single pattern enclosed in parentheses without a trailing comma (e.g. `(3 | 4)`) is a [group pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#group-patterns). While a single pattern enclosed in square brackets (e.g. `[3 | 4]`) is still a sequence pattern.
At most one star subpattern may be in a sequence pattern. The star subpattern may occur in any position. If no star subpattern is present, the sequence pattern is a fixed-length sequence pattern; otherwise it is a variable-length sequence pattern.
The following is the logical flow for matching a sequence pattern against a subject value:
  1. If the subject value is not a sequence [[2]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#id21), the sequence pattern fails.
  2. If the subject value is an instance of `str`, `bytes` or `bytearray` the sequence pattern fails.
  3. The subsequent steps depend on whether the sequence pattern is fixed or variable-length.
If the sequence pattern is fixed-length:
    1. If the length of the subject sequence is not equal to the number of subpatterns, the sequence pattern fails
    2. Subpatterns in the sequence pattern are matched to their corresponding items in the subject sequence from left to right. Matching stops as soon as a subpattern fails. If all subpatterns succeed in matching their corresponding item, the sequence pattern succeeds.
Otherwise, if the sequence pattern is variable-length:
    1. If the length of the subject sequence is less than the number of non-star subpatterns, the sequence pattern fails.
    2. The leading non-star subpatterns are matched to their corresponding items as for fixed-length sequences.
    3. If the previous step succeeds, the star subpattern matches a list formed of the remaining subject items, excluding the remaining items corresponding to non-star subpatterns following the star subpattern.
    4. Remaining non-star subpatterns are matched to their corresponding subject items, as for a fixed-length sequence.
Note
The length of the subject sequence is obtained via [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") (i.e. via the `__len__()` protocol). This length may be cached by the interpreter in a similar manner as [value patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#value-patterns).


In simple terms `[P1, P2, P3,` … `, P<N>]` matches only if all the following happens:
  * check `<subject>` is a sequence
  * `len(subject) == <N>`
  * `P1` matches `<subject>[0]` (note that this match can also bind names)
  * `P2` matches `<subject>[1]` (note that this match can also bind names)
  * … and so on for the corresponding pattern/element.


####  8.6.4.9. Mapping Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#mapping-patterns "Link to this heading")
A mapping pattern contains one or more key-value patterns. The syntax is similar to the construction of a dictionary. Syntax:
```
**mapping_pattern**     ::= "{" [[items_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-items_pattern)] "}"

**key_value_pattern**   ::= ([literal_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-literal_pattern) | [value_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-value_pattern)) ":" [pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern)

```

At most one double star pattern may be in a mapping pattern. The double star pattern must be the last subpattern in the mapping pattern.
Duplicate keys in mapping patterns are disallowed. Duplicate literal keys will raise a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError"). Two keys that otherwise have the same value will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") at runtime.
The following is the logical flow for matching a mapping pattern against a subject value:
  1. If the subject value is not a mapping [[3]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#id22),the mapping pattern fails.
  2. If every key given in the mapping pattern is present in the subject mapping, and the pattern for each key matches the corresponding item of the subject mapping, the mapping pattern succeeds.
  3. If duplicate keys are detected in the mapping pattern, the pattern is considered invalid. A [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") is raised for duplicate literal values; or a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") for named keys of the same value.


Note
Key-value pairs are matched using the two-argument form of the mapping subject’s `get()` method. Matched key-value pairs must already be present in the mapping, and not created on-the-fly via `__missing__()` or [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__").
In simple terms `{KEY1: P1, KEY2: P2, ... }` matches only if all the following happens:
  * check `<subject>` is a mapping
  * `KEY1 in <subject>`
  * `P1` matches `<subject>[KEY1]`
  * … and so on for the corresponding KEY/pattern pair.


####  8.6.4.10. Class Patterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-patterns "Link to this heading")
A class pattern represents a class and its positional and keyword arguments (if any). Syntax:
```
**class_pattern**       ::= [name_or_attr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-name_or_attr) "(" [[pattern_arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern_arguments) ","?] ")"
**pattern_arguments**   ::= [positional_patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-positional_patterns) ["," [keyword_patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_patterns)]
                        | [keyword_patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_patterns)
**positional_patterns** ::= ",".[pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern)+
**keyword_patterns**    ::= ",".[keyword_pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_pattern)+
**keyword_pattern**     ::= NAME "=" [pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pattern)

```

The same keyword should not be repeated in class patterns.
The following is the logical flow for matching a class pattern against a subject value:
  1. If `name_or_attr` is not an instance of the builtin [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") , raise [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
  2. If the subject value is not an instance of `name_or_attr` (tested via [`isinstance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance "isinstance")), the class pattern fails.
  3. If no pattern arguments are present, the pattern succeeds. Otherwise, the subsequent steps depend on whether keyword or positional argument patterns are present.
For a number of built-in types (specified below), a single positional subpattern is accepted which will match the entire subject; for these types keyword patterns also work as for other types.
If only keyword patterns are present, they are processed as follows, one by one:
I. The keyword is looked up as an attribute on the subject.
>      * If this raises an exception other than [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"), the exception bubbles up.
>      * If this raises [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"), the class pattern has failed.
>      * Else, the subpattern associated with the keyword pattern is matched against the subject’s attribute value. If this fails, the class pattern fails; if this succeeds, the match proceeds to the next keyword.
II. If all keyword patterns succeed, the class pattern succeeds.
If any positional patterns are present, they are converted to keyword patterns using the [`__match_args__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__match_args__ "object.__match_args__") attribute on the class `name_or_attr` before matching:
I. The equivalent of `getattr(cls, "__match_args__", ())` is called.
>      * If this raises an exception, the exception bubbles up.
>      * If the returned value is not a tuple, the conversion fails and [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.
>      * If there are more positional patterns than `len(cls.__match_args__)`, [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.
>      * Otherwise, positional pattern `i` is converted to a keyword pattern using `__match_args__[i]` as the keyword. `__match_args__[i]` must be a string; if not [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.
>      * If there are duplicate keywords, [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.
> See also
> [Customizing positional arguments in class pattern matching](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#class-pattern-matching) 

II. Once all positional patterns have been converted to keyword patterns,
    
the match proceeds as if there were only keyword patterns.
For the following built-in types the handling of positional subpatterns is different:
     * [`bool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "bool")
     * [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray")
     * [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes")
     * [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict")
     * [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float")
     * [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset")
     * [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int")
     * [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list")
     * [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set")
     * [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str")
     * [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")
These classes accept a single positional argument, and the pattern there is matched against the whole object rather than an attribute. For example `int(0|1)` matches the value `0`, but not the value `0.0`.


In simple terms `CLS(P1, attr=P2)` matches only if the following happens:
  * `isinstance(<subject>, CLS)`
  * convert `P1` to a keyword pattern using `CLS.__match_args__`
  * For each keyword argument `attr=P2`:
    * `hasattr(<subject>, "attr")`
    * `P2` matches `<subject>.attr`
  * … and so on for the corresponding keyword argument/pattern pair.

```

A function definition is an executable statement. Its execution binds the function name in the current local namespace to a function object (a wrapper around the executable code for the function). This function object contains a reference to the current global namespace as the global namespace to be used when the function is called.
The function definition does not execute the function body; this gets executed only when the function is called. [[4]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#id23)
A function definition may be wrapped by one or more [decorator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator) expressions. Decorator expressions are evaluated when the function is defined, in the scope that contains the function definition. The result must be a callable, which is invoked with the function object as the only argument. The returned value is bound to the function name instead of the function object. Multiple decorators are applied in nested fashion. For example, the following code
Copy```
@f1(arg)
@f2
deffunc(): pass

```

is roughly equivalent to
Copy```
deffunc(): pass
func = f1(arg)(f2(func))

```

except that the original function is not temporarily bound to the name `func`.
Changed in version 3.9: Functions may be decorated with any valid [`assignment_expression`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression). Previously, the grammar was much more restrictive; see [**PEP 614**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0614/) for details.
A list of [type parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) may be given in square brackets between the function’s name and the opening parenthesis for its parameter list. This indicates to static type checkers that the function is generic. At runtime, the type parameters can be retrieved from the function’s [`__type_params__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__type_params__ "function.__type_params__") attribute. See [Generic functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions) for more.
Changed in version 3.12: Type parameter lists are new in Python 3.12.
When one or more [parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter) have the form _parameter_ `=` _expression_ , the function is said to have “default parameter values.” For a parameter with a default value, the corresponding [argument](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument) may be omitted from a call, in which case the parameter’s default value is substituted. If a parameter has a default value, all following parameters up until the “`*`” must also have a default value — this is a syntactic restriction that is not expressed by the grammar.
**Default parameter values are evaluated from left to right when the function definition is executed.** This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the function is defined, and that the same “pre-computed” value is used for each call. This is especially important to understand when a default parameter value is a mutable object, such as a list or a dictionary: if the function modifies the object (e.g. by appending an item to a list), the default parameter value is in effect modified. This is generally not what was intended. A way around this is to use `None` as the default, and explicitly test for it in the body of the function, e.g.:
Copy```
defwhats_on_the_telly(penguin=None):
    if penguin is None:
        penguin = []
    penguin.append("property of the zoo")
    return penguin

```

Function call semantics are described in more detail in section [Calls](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls). A function call always assigns values to all parameters mentioned in the parameter list, either from positional arguments, from keyword arguments, or from default values. If the form “`*identifier`” is present, it is initialized to a tuple receiving any excess positional parameters, defaulting to the empty tuple. If the form “`**identifier`” is present, it is initialized to a new ordered mapping receiving any excess keyword arguments, defaulting to a new empty mapping of the same type. Parameters after “`*`” or “`*identifier`” are keyword-only parameters and may only be passed by keyword arguments. Parameters before “`/`” are positional-only parameters and may only be passed by positional arguments.
Changed in version 3.8: The `/` function parameter syntax may be used to indicate positional-only parameters. See [**PEP 570**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570/) for details.
Parameters may have an [annotation](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-function-annotation) of the form “`: expression`” following the parameter name. Any parameter may have an annotation, even those of the form `*identifier` or `**identifier`. (As a special case, parameters of the form `*identifier` may have an annotation “`: *expression`”.) Functions may have “return” annotation of the form “`-> expression`” after the parameter list. These annotations can be any valid Python expression. The presence of annotations does not change the semantics of a function. The annotation values are available as values of a dictionary keyed by the parameters’ names in the `__annotations__` attribute of the function object. If the `annotations` import from [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions") is used, annotations are preserved as strings at runtime which enables postponed evaluation. Otherwise, they are evaluated when the function definition is executed. In this case annotations may be evaluated in a different order than they appear in the source code.
Changed in version 3.11: Parameters of the form “`*identifier`” may have an annotation “`: *expression`”. See [**PEP 646**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/).
It is also possible to create anonymous functions (functions not bound to a name), for immediate use in expressions. This uses lambda expressions, described in section [Lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda). Note that the lambda expression is merely a shorthand for a simplified function definition; a function defined in a “[`def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#def)” statement can be passed around or assigned to another name just like a function defined by a lambda expression. The “`def`” form is actually more powerful since it allows the execution of multiple statements and annotations.
**Programmer’s note:** Functions are first-class objects. A “`def`” statement executed inside a function definition defines a local function that can be returned or passed around. Free variables used in the nested function can access the local variables of the function containing the def. See section [Naming and binding](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming) for details.

##  8.8. Class definitions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions "Link to this heading")
A class definition defines a class object (see section [The standard type hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types)):
```
**classdef**    ::= [[decorators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-decorators)] "class" [classname](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-classname) [[type_params](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-type_params)] [[inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-inheritance)] ":" [suite](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-suite)
**inheritance** ::= "(" [[argument_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-argument_list)] ")"
**classname**   ::= [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)

```

A class definition is an executable statement. The inheritance list usually gives a list of base classes (see [Metaclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses) for more advanced uses), so each item in the list should evaluate to a class object which allows subclassing. Classes without an inheritance list inherit, by default, from the base class [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"); hence,
Copy```
classFoo:
    pass

```

is equivalent to
Copy```
classFoo(object):
    pass

```

The class’s suite is then executed in a new execution frame (see [Naming and binding](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming)), using a newly created local namespace and the original global namespace. (Usually, the suite contains mostly function definitions.) When the class’s suite finishes execution, its execution frame is discarded but its local namespace is saved. [[5]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#id24) A class object is then created using the inheritance list for the base classes and the saved local namespace for the attribute dictionary. The class name is bound to this class object in the original local namespace.
The order in which attributes are defined in the class body is preserved in the new class’s [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__dict__ "type.__dict__"). Note that this is reliable only right after the class is created and only for classes that were defined using the definition syntax.
Class creation can be customized heavily using [metaclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses).
Classes can also be decorated: just like when decorating functions,
Copy```
@f1(arg)
@f2
classFoo: pass

```

is roughly equivalent to
Copy```
classFoo: pass
Foo = f1(arg)(f2(Foo))

```

The evaluation rules for the decorator expressions are the same as for function decorators. The result is then bound to the class name.
Changed in version 3.9: Classes may be decorated with any valid [`assignment_expression`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression). Previously, the grammar was much more restrictive; see [**PEP 614**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0614/) for details.
A list of [type parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) may be given in square brackets immediately after the class’s name. This indicates to static type checkers that the class is generic. At runtime, the type parameters can be retrieved from the class’s [`__type_params__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__type_params__ "type.__type_params__") attribute. See [Generic classes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes) for more.
Changed in version 3.12: Type parameter lists are new in Python 3.12.
**Programmer’s note:** Variables defined in the class definition are class attributes; they are shared by instances. Instance attributes can be set in a method with `self.name = value`. Both class and instance attributes are accessible through the notation “`self.name`”, and an instance attribute hides a class attribute with the same name when accessed in this way. Class attributes can be used as defaults for instance attributes, but using mutable values there can lead to unexpected results. [Descriptors](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors) can be used to create instance variables with different implementation details.

Execution of Python coroutines can be suspended and resumed at many points (see [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine)). [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await) expressions, [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) and [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with) can only be used in the body of a coroutine function.
Functions defined with `async def` syntax are always coroutine functions, even if they do not contain `await` or `async` keywords.
It is a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") to use a `yield from` expression inside the body of a coroutine function.
An example of a coroutine function:
Copy```
async deffunc(param1, param2):
    do_stuff()
    await some_coroutine()

```

Changed in version 3.7: `await` and `async` are now keywords; previously they were only treated as such inside the body of a coroutine function.
###  8.9.2. The `async for` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-async-for-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**async_for_stmt** ::= "async" [for_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-for_stmt)

```

An [asynchronous iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterable) provides an `__aiter__` method that directly returns an [asynchronous iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator), which can call asynchronous code in its `__anext__` method.
The `async for` statement allows convenient iteration over asynchronous iterables.
The following code:
Copy```
async for TARGET in ITER:
    SUITE
else:
    SUITE2

```

Is semantically equivalent to:
Copy```
iter = (ITER)
iter = type(iter).__aiter__(iter)
running = True

while running:
    try:
        TARGET = await type(iter).__anext__(iter)
    except StopAsyncIteration:
        running = False
    else:
        SUITE
else:
    SUITE2

```

See also [`__aiter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aiter__ "object.__aiter__") and [`__anext__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__anext__ "object.__anext__") for details.
It is a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") to use an `async for` statement outside the body of a coroutine function.
###  8.9.3. The `async with` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-async-with-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**async_with_stmt** ::= "async" [with_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-with_stmt)

```

An [asynchronous context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-context-manager) is a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-context-manager) that is able to suspend execution in its _enter_ and _exit_ methods.
The following code:
Copy```
async with EXPRESSION as TARGET:
    SUITE

```

is semantically equivalent to:
Copy```
manager = (EXPRESSION)
aenter = type(manager).__aenter__
aexit = type(manager).__aexit__
value = await aenter(manager)
hit_except = False

try:
    TARGET = value
    SUITE
except:
    hit_except = True
    if not await aexit(manager, *sys.exc_info()):
        raise
finally:
    if not hit_except:
        await aexit(manager, None, None, None)

```

See also [`__aenter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aenter__ "object.__aenter__") and [`__aexit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") for details.
It is a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") to use an `async with` statement outside the body of a coroutine function.

##  8.10. Type parameter lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-parameter-lists "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.12.
Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added (see [**PEP 696**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/)).
```
**type_params**  ::= "[" [type_param](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-type_param) ("," [type_param](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-type_param))* "]"
**type_param**   ::= [typevar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-typevar) | [typevartuple](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-typevartuple) | [paramspec](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-paramspec)

```

[ Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#def) (including [coroutines](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def)), [classes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class) and [type aliases](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type) may contain a type parameter list:
Copy```
defmax[T](args: list[T]) -> T:
    ...

async defamax[T](args: list[T]) -> T:
    ...

classBag[T]:
    def__iter__(self) -> Iterator[T]:
        ...

    defadd(self, arg: T) -> None:
        ...

type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]

```

Semantically, this indicates that the function, class, or type alias is generic over a type variable. This information is primarily used by static type checkers, and at runtime, generic objects behave much like their non-generic counterparts.
Type parameters are declared in square brackets (`[]`) immediately after the name of the function, class, or type alias. The type parameters are accessible within the scope of the generic object, but not elsewhere. Thus, after a declaration `def func[T](): pass`, the name `T` is not available in the module scope. Below, the semantics of generic objects are described with more precision. The scope of type parameters is modeled with a special function (technically, an [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes)) that wraps the creation of the generic object.
Generic functions, classes, and type aliases have a [`__type_params__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__type_params__ "definition.__type_params__") attribute listing their type parameters.
Type parameters come in three kinds:
  * [`typing.TypeVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar"), introduced by a plain name (e.g., `T`). Semantically, this represents a single type to a type checker.
  * [`typing.TypeVarTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVarTuple "typing.TypeVarTuple"), introduced by a name prefixed with a single asterisk (e.g., `*Ts`). Semantically, this stands for a tuple of any number of types.
  * [`typing.ParamSpec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec"), introduced by a name prefixed with two asterisks (e.g., `**P`). Semantically, this stands for the parameters of a callable.


[`typing.TypeVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") declarations can define _bounds_ and _constraints_ with a colon (`:`) followed by an expression. A single expression after the colon indicates a bound (e.g. `T: int`). Semantically, this means that the `typing.TypeVar` can only represent types that are a subtype of this bound. A parenthesized tuple of expressions after the colon indicates a set of constraints (e.g. `T: (str, bytes)`). Each member of the tuple should be a type (again, this is not enforced at runtime). Constrained type variables can only take on one of the types in the list of constraints.
For `typing.TypeVar`s declared using the type parameter list syntax, the bound and constraints are not evaluated when the generic object is created, but only when the value is explicitly accessed through the attributes `__bound__` and `__constraints__`. To accomplish this, the bounds or constraints are evaluated in a separate [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes).
[`typing.TypeVarTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVarTuple "typing.TypeVarTuple")s and [`typing.ParamSpec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec")s cannot have bounds or constraints.
All three flavors of type parameters can also have a _default value_ , which is used when the type parameter is not explicitly provided. This is added by appending a single equals sign (`=`) followed by an expression. Like the bounds and constraints of type variables, the default value is not evaluated when the object is created, but only when the type parameter’s `__default__` attribute is accessed. To this end, the default value is evaluated in a separate [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes). If no default value is specified for a type parameter, the `__default__` attribute is set to the special sentinel object [`typing.NoDefault`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault").
The following example indicates the full set of allowed type parameter declarations:
Copy```
defoverly_generic[
   SimpleTypeVar,
   TypeVarWithDefault = int,
   TypeVarWithBound: int,
   TypeVarWithConstraints: (str, bytes),
   *SimpleTypeVarTuple = (int, float),
   **SimpleParamSpec = (str, bytearray),
](
   a: SimpleTypeVar,
   b: TypeVarWithDefault,
   c: TypeVarWithBound,
   d: Callable[SimpleParamSpec, TypeVarWithConstraints],
   *e: SimpleTypeVarTuple,
): ...

```

###  8.10.1. Generic functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions "Link to this heading")
Generic functions are declared as follows:
Copy```
deffunc[T](arg: T): ...

```

This syntax is equivalent to:
Copy```
annotation-defTYPE_PARAMS_OF_func():
    T = typing.TypeVar("T")
    deffunc(arg: T): ...
    func.__type_params__ = (T,)
    return func
func = TYPE_PARAMS_OF_func()

```

Here `annotation-def` indicates an [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes), which is not actually bound to any name at runtime. (One other liberty is taken in the translation: the syntax does not go through attribute access on the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\).") module, but creates an instance of [`typing.TypeVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") directly.)
The annotations of generic functions are evaluated within the annotation scope used for declaring the type parameters, but the function’s defaults and decorators are not.
The following example illustrates the scoping rules for these cases, as well as for additional flavors of type parameters:
Copy```
@decorator
deffunc[T: int, *Ts, **P](*args: *Ts, arg: Callable[P, T] = some_default):
    ...

```

Except for the [lazy evaluation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation) of the [`TypeVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") bound, this is equivalent to:
Copy```
DEFAULT_OF_arg = some_default

annotation-defTYPE_PARAMS_OF_func():

    annotation-defBOUND_OF_T():
        return int
    # In reality, BOUND_OF_T() is evaluated only on demand.
    T = typing.TypeVar("T", bound=BOUND_OF_T())

    Ts = typing.TypeVarTuple("Ts")
    P = typing.ParamSpec("P")

    deffunc(*args: *Ts, arg: Callable[P, T] = DEFAULT_OF_arg):
        ...

    func.__type_params__ = (T, Ts, P)
    return func
func = decorator(TYPE_PARAMS_OF_func())

```

The capitalized names like `DEFAULT_OF_arg` are not actually bound at runtime.
###  8.10.2. Generic classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes "Link to this heading")
Generic classes are declared as follows:
Copy```
classBag[T]: ...

```

This syntax is equivalent to:
Copy```
annotation-defTYPE_PARAMS_OF_Bag():
    T = typing.TypeVar("T")
    classBag(typing.Generic[T]):
        __type_params__ = (T,)
        ...
    return Bag
Bag = TYPE_PARAMS_OF_Bag()

```

Here again `annotation-def` (not a real keyword) indicates an [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes), and the name `TYPE_PARAMS_OF_Bag` is not actually bound at runtime.
Generic classes implicitly inherit from [`typing.Generic`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic "typing.Generic"). The base classes and keyword arguments of generic classes are evaluated within the type scope for the type parameters, and decorators are evaluated outside that scope. This is illustrated by this example:
Copy```
@decorator
classBag(Base[T], arg=T): ...

```

This is equivalent to:
Copy```
annotation-defTYPE_PARAMS_OF_Bag():
    T = typing.TypeVar("T")
    classBag(Base[T], typing.Generic[T], arg=T):
        __type_params__ = (T,)
        ...
    return Bag
Bag = decorator(TYPE_PARAMS_OF_Bag())

```

###  8.10.3. Generic type aliases[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-type-aliases "Link to this heading")
The [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement can also be used to create a generic type alias:
Copy```
type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]

```

Except for the [lazy evaluation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation) of the value, this is equivalent to:
Copy```
annotation-defTYPE_PARAMS_OF_ListOrSet():
    T = typing.TypeVar("T")

    annotation-defVALUE_OF_ListOrSet():
        return list[T] | set[T]
    # In reality, the value is lazily evaluated
    return typing.TypeAliasType("ListOrSet", VALUE_OF_ListOrSet(), type_params=(T,))
ListOrSet = TYPE_PARAMS_OF_ListOrSet()

```

Here, `annotation-def` (not a real keyword) indicates an [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes). The capitalized names like `TYPE_PARAMS_OF_ListOrSet` are not actually bound at runtime.

#  1. Introduction[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#introduction "Link to this heading")
This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is not intended as a tutorial.
While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would like to see a more formal definition of the language, maybe you could volunteer your time — or invent a cloning machine :-).
It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language reference document — the implementation may change, and other implementations of the same language may work differently. On the other hand, CPython is the one Python implementation in widespread use (although alternate implementations continue to gain support), and its particular quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned, especially where the implementation imposes additional limitations. Therefore, you’ll find short “implementation notes” sprinkled throughout the text.
Every Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and standard modules. These are documented in [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). A few built-in modules are mentioned when they interact in a significant way with the language definition.
##  1.1. Alternate Implementations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#alternate-implementations "Link to this heading")
Though there is one Python implementation which is by far the most popular, there are some alternate implementations which are of particular interest to different audiences.
Known implementations include: 

CPython
    
This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written in C. New language features generally appear here first. 

Jython
    
Python implemented in Java. This implementation can be used as a scripting language for Java applications, or can be used to create applications using the Java class libraries. It is also often used to create tests for Java libraries. More information can be found at [the Jython website](https://www.jython.org/). 

Python for .NET
    
This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries available. It was created by Brian Lloyd. For more information, see the [Python for .NET home page](https://pythonnet.github.io/). 

IronPython
    
An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython. For more information, see [the IronPython website](https://ironpython.net/). 

PyPy
    
An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports several advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python). Additional information is available on [the PyPy project’s home page](https://pypy.org/).
Each of these implementations varies in some way from the language as documented in this manual, or introduces specific information beyond what’s covered in the standard Python documentation. Please refer to the implementation-specific documentation to determine what else you need to know about the specific implementation you’re using.
##  1.2. Notation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#notation "Link to this heading")
The descriptions of lexical analysis and syntax use a modified [Backus–Naur form (BNF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) grammar notation. This uses the following style of definition:
```
**name**      ::= [lc_letter](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#grammar-token-notation-lc_letter) ([lc_letter](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#grammar-token-notation-lc_letter) | "_")*
**lc_letter** ::= "a"..."z"

```

The first line says that a `name` is an `lc_letter` followed by a sequence of zero or more `lc_letter`s and underscores. An `lc_letter` in turn is any of the single characters `'a'` through `'z'`. (This rule is actually adhered to for the names defined in lexical and grammar rules in this document.)
Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and `::=`. A vertical bar (`|`) is used to separate alternatives; it is the least binding operator in this notation. A star (`*`) means zero or more repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (`+`) means one or more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets (`[ ]`) means zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional). The `*` and `+` operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are used for grouping. Literal strings are enclosed in quotes. White space is only meaningful to separate tokens. Rules are normally contained on a single line; rules with many alternatives may be formatted alternatively with each line after the first beginning with a vertical bar.
In lexical definitions (as the example above), two more conventions are used: Two literal characters separated by three dots mean a choice of any single character in the given (inclusive) range of ASCII characters. A phrase between angular brackets (`<...>`) gives an informal description of the symbol defined; e.g., this could be used to describe the notion of ‘control character’ if needed.
Even though the notation used is almost the same, there is a big difference between the meaning of lexical and syntactic definitions: a lexical definition operates on the individual characters of the input source, while a syntax definition operates on the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analysis. All uses of BNF in the next chapter (“Lexical Analysis”) are lexical definitions; uses in subsequent chapters are syntactic definitions.

#  9. Top-level components[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#top-level-components "Link to this heading")
The Python interpreter can get its input from a number of sources: from a script passed to it as standard input or as program argument, typed in interactively, from a module source file, etc. This chapter gives the syntax used in these cases.
##  9.1. Complete Python programs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#complete-python-programs "Link to this heading")
[`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") (various system services), [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.") (built-in functions, exceptions and `None`) and [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``."). The latter is used to provide the local and global namespace for execution of the complete program.
The syntax for a complete Python program is that for file input, described in the next section.
The interpreter may also be invoked in interactive mode; in this case, it does not read and execute a complete program but reads and executes one statement (possibly compound) at a time. The initial environment is identical to that of a complete program; each statement is executed in the namespace of [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.").
A complete program can be passed to the interpreter in three forms: with the [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) _string_ command line option, as a file passed as the first command line argument, or as standard input. If the file or standard input is a tty device, the interpreter enters interactive mode; otherwise, it executes the file as a complete program.
##  9.2. File input[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#file-input "Link to this heading")
All input read from non-interactive files has the same form:
```
**file_input** ::= (NEWLINE | [statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-statement))*

```

This syntax is used in the following situations:
  * when parsing a complete Python program (from a file or from a string);
  * when parsing a module;
  * when parsing a string passed to the [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") function;


##  9.3. Interactive input[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#interactive-input "Link to this heading")
Input in interactive mode is parsed using the following grammar:
```
**interactive_input** ::= [[stmt_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stmt_list)] NEWLINE | [compound_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-compound_stmt) NEWLINE

```

Note that a (top-level) compound statement must be followed by a blank line in interactive mode; this is needed to help the parser detect the end of the input.
##  9.4. Expression input[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#expression-input "Link to this heading")
[`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") is used for expression input. It ignores leading whitespace. The string argument to [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") must have the following form:
```
**eval_input** ::= [expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression_list) NEWLINE*

```

#  4. Execution model[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#execution-model "Link to this heading")
##  4.1. Structure of a program[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#structure-of-a-program "Link to this heading")
A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A _block_ is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block. A script command (a command specified on the interpreter command line with the [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) option) is a code block. A module run as a top level script (as module `__main__`) from the command line using a [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) argument is also a code block. The string argument passed to the built-in functions [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") and [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") is a code block.
A code block is executed in an _execution frame_. A frame contains some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines where and how execution continues after the code block’s execution has completed.
##  4.2. Naming and binding[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming-and-binding "Link to this heading")
###  4.2.1. Binding of names[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#binding-of-names "Link to this heading")
_Names_ refer to objects. Names are introduced by name binding operations.
The following constructs bind names:
  * formal parameters to functions,
  * class definitions,
  * function definitions,
  * assignment expressions,
  * [targets](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment) that are identifiers if occurring in an assignment:
    * [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) loop header,
    * after `as` in a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement, [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause, [`except*`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star) clause, or in the as-pattern in structural pattern matching,
    * in a capture pattern in structural pattern matching
  * [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statements.
  * [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statements.
  * [type parameter lists](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params).


The `import` statement of the form `from ... import *` binds all names defined in the imported module, except those beginning with an underscore. This form may only be used at the module level.
A target occurring in a [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) statement is also considered bound for this purpose (though the actual semantics are to unbind the name).
Each assignment or import statement occurs within a block defined by a class or function definition or at the module level (the top-level code block).
If a name is bound in a block, it is a local variable of that block, unless declared as [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) or [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global). If a name is bound at the module level, it is a global variable. (The variables of the module code block are local and global.) If a variable is used in a code block but not defined there, it is a [free variable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-free-variable).
Each occurrence of a name in the program text refers to the _binding_ of that name established by the following name resolution rules.
###  4.2.2. Resolution of names[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#resolution-of-names "Link to this heading")
A _scope_ defines the visibility of a name within a block. If a local variable is defined in a block, its scope includes that block. If the definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces a different binding for the name.
When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest enclosing scope. The set of all such scopes visible to a code block is called the block’s _environment_.
When a name is not found at all, a [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError") exception is raised. If the current scope is a function scope, and the name refers to a local variable that has not yet been bound to a value at the point where the name is used, an [`UnboundLocalError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnboundLocalError "UnboundLocalError") exception is raised. [`UnboundLocalError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnboundLocalError "UnboundLocalError") is a subclass of [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError").
If a name binding operation occurs anywhere within a code block, all uses of the name within the block are treated as references to the current block. This can lead to errors when a name is used within a block before it is bound. This rule is subtle. Python lacks declarations and allows name binding operations to occur anywhere within a code block. The local variables of a code block can be determined by scanning the entire text of the block for name binding operations. See [the FAQ entry on UnboundLocalError](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#faq-unboundlocalerror) for examples.
If the [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement occurs within a block, all uses of the names specified in the statement refer to the bindings of those names in the top-level namespace. Names are resolved in the top-level namespace by searching the global namespace, i.e. the namespace of the module containing the code block, and the builtins namespace, the namespace of the module [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."). The global namespace is searched first. If the names are not found there, the builtins namespace is searched next. If the names are also not found in the builtins namespace, new variables are created in the global namespace. The global statement must precede all uses of the listed names.
The [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement has the same scope as a name binding operation in the same block. If the nearest enclosing scope for a free variable contains a global statement, the free variable is treated as a global.
The [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement causes corresponding names to refer to previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing function scope. [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") is raised at compile time if the given name does not exist in any enclosing function scope. [Type parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) cannot be rebound with the `nonlocal` statement.
The namespace for a module is automatically created the first time a module is imported. The main module for a script is always called [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.").
Class definition blocks and arguments to [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") and [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") are special in the context of name resolution. A class definition is an executable statement that may use and define names. These references follow the normal rules for name resolution with an exception that unbound local variables are looked up in the global namespace. The namespace of the class definition becomes the attribute dictionary of the class. The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods. This includes comprehensions and generator expressions, but it does not include [annotation scopes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes), which have access to their enclosing class scopes. This means that the following will fail:
Copy```
classA:
    a = 42
    b = list(a + i for i in range(10))

```

However, the following will succeed:
Copy```
classA:
    type Alias = Nested
    classNested: pass

print(A.Alias.__value__)  # <type 'A.Nested'>

```

###  4.2.3. Annotation scopes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes "Link to this heading")
[Type parameter lists](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) and [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statements introduce _annotation scopes_ , which behave mostly like function scopes, but with some exceptions discussed below. [Annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-annotation) currently do not use annotation scopes, but they are expected to use annotation scopes in Python 3.13 when [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/) is implemented.
Annotation scopes are used in the following contexts:
  * Type parameter lists for [generic type aliases](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-type-aliases).
  * Type parameter lists for [generic functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions). A generic function’s annotations are executed within the annotation scope, but its defaults and decorators are not.
  * Type parameter lists for [generic classes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes). A generic class’s base classes and keyword arguments are executed within the annotation scope, but its decorators are not.
  * The bounds, constraints, and default values for type parameters ([lazily evaluated](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation)).
  * The value of type aliases ([lazily evaluated](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation)).


Annotation scopes differ from function scopes in the following ways:
  * Annotation scopes have access to their enclosing class namespace. If an annotation scope is immediately within a class scope, or within another annotation scope that is immediately within a class scope, the code in the annotation scope can use names defined in the class scope as if it were executed directly within the class body. This contrasts with regular functions defined within classes, which cannot access names defined in the class scope.
  * Expressions in annotation scopes cannot contain [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield), `yield from`, [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await), or [`:=`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) expressions. (These expressions are allowed in other scopes contained within the annotation scope.)
  * Names defined in annotation scopes cannot be rebound with [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statements in inner scopes. This includes only type parameters, as no other syntactic elements that can appear within annotation scopes can introduce new names.
  * While annotation scopes have an internal name, that name is not reflected in the [qualified name](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-qualified-name) of objects defined within the scope. Instead, the [`__qualname__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__qualname__ "definition.__qualname__") of such objects is as if the object were defined in the enclosing scope.


Added in version 3.12: Annotation scopes were introduced in Python 3.12 as part of [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).
Changed in version 3.13: Annotation scopes are also used for type parameter defaults, as introduced by [**PEP 696**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/).
###  4.2.4. Lazy evaluation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation "Link to this heading")
The values of type aliases created through the [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement are _lazily evaluated_. The same applies to the bounds, constraints, and default values of type variables created through the [type parameter syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params). This means that they are not evaluated when the type alias or type variable is created. Instead, they are only evaluated when doing so is necessary to resolve an attribute access.
Example:
Copy```
>>> type Alias = 1/0
>>> Alias.__value__
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>> deffunc[T: 1/0](): pass
>>> T = func.__type_params__[0]
>>> T.__bound__
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

```

Here the exception is raised only when the `__value__` attribute of the type alias or the `__bound__` attribute of the type variable is accessed.
This behavior is primarily useful for references to types that have not yet been defined when the type alias or type variable is created. For example, lazy evaluation enables creation of mutually recursive type aliases:
Copy```
fromtypingimport Literal

type SimpleExpr = int | Parenthesized
type Parenthesized = tuple[Literal["("], Expr, Literal[")"]]
type Expr = SimpleExpr | tuple[SimpleExpr, Literal["+", "-"], Expr]

```

Lazily evaluated values are evaluated in [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes), which means that names that appear inside the lazily evaluated value are looked up as if they were used in the immediately enclosing scope.
Added in version 3.12.
###  4.2.5. Builtins and restricted execution[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#builtins-and-restricted-execution "Link to this heading")
**CPython implementation detail:** Users should not touch `__builtins__`; it is strictly an implementation detail. Users wanting to override values in the builtins namespace should [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) the [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.") module and modify its attributes appropriately.
The builtins namespace associated with the execution of a code block is actually found by looking up the name `__builtins__` in its global namespace; this should be a dictionary or a module (in the latter case the module’s dictionary is used). By default, when in the [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.") module, `__builtins__` is the built-in module [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."); when in any other module, `__builtins__` is an alias for the dictionary of the [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.") module itself.
###  4.2.6. Interaction with dynamic features[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#interaction-with-dynamic-features "Link to this heading")
Name resolution of free variables occurs at runtime, not at compile time. This means that the following code will print 42:
Copy```
i = 10
deff():
    print(i)
i = 42
f()

```

The [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") and [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") functions do not have access to the full environment for resolving names. Names may be resolved in the local and global namespaces of the caller. Free variables are not resolved in the nearest enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#id5) The [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") and [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") functions have optional arguments to override the global and local namespace. If only one namespace is specified, it is used for both.
##  4.3. Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#exceptions "Link to this heading")
_raised_ at the point where the error is detected; it may be _handled_ by the surrounding code block or by any code block that directly or indirectly invoked the code block where the error occurred.
The Python interpreter raises an exception when it detects a run-time error (such as division by zero). A Python program can also explicitly raise an exception with the [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) statement. Exception handlers are specified with the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) … [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) statement. The [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause of such a statement can be used to specify cleanup code which does not handle the exception, but is executed whether an exception occurred or not in the preceding code.
Python uses the “termination” model of error handling: an exception handler can find out what happened and continue execution at an outer level, but it cannot repair the cause of the error and retry the failing operation (except by re-entering the offending piece of code from the top).
When an exception is not handled at all, the interpreter terminates execution of the program, or returns to its interactive main loop. In either case, it prints a stack traceback, except when the exception is [`SystemExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit "SystemExit").
Exceptions are identified by class instances. The [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause is selected depending on the class of the instance: it must reference the class of the instance or a [non-virtual base class](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class) thereof. The instance can be received by the handler and can carry additional information about the exceptional condition.
Note
Exception messages are not part of the Python API. Their contents may change from one version of Python to the next without warning and should not be relied on by code which will run under multiple versions of the interpreter.
See also the description of the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement in section [The try statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) statement in section [The raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise).
Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#id3)]
This limitation occurs because the code that is executed by these operations is not available at the time the module is compiled.

#  2. Lexical analysis[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#lexical-analysis "Link to this heading")
A Python program is read by a _parser_. Input to the parser is a stream of [tokens](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-token), generated by the _lexical analyzer_ (also known as the _tokenizer_). This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.
Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a source file can be given by an encoding declaration and defaults to UTF-8, see [**PEP 3120**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3120/) for details. If the source file cannot be decoded, a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") is raised.
##  2.1. Line structure[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#line-structure "Link to this heading")
A Python program is divided into a number of _logical lines_.
###  2.1.1. Logical lines[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#logical-lines "Link to this heading")
The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINE. Statements cannot cross logical line boundaries except where NEWLINE is allowed by the syntax (e.g., between statements in compound statements). A logical line is constructed from one or more _physical lines_ by following the explicit or implicit _line joining_ rules.
###  2.1.2. Physical lines[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#physical-lines "Link to this heading")
A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line sequence. In source files and strings, any of the standard platform line termination sequences can be used - the Unix form using ASCII LF (linefeed), the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by linefeed), or the old Macintosh form using the ASCII CR (return) character. All of these forms can be used equally, regardless of platform. The end of input also serves as an implicit terminator for the final physical line.
When embedding Python, source code strings should be passed to Python APIs using the standard C conventions for newline characters (the `\n` character, representing ASCII LF, is the line terminator).
###  2.1.3. Comments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#comments "Link to this heading")
A comment starts with a hash character (`#`) that is not part of a string literal, and ends at the end of the physical line. A comment signifies the end of the logical line unless the implicit line joining rules are invoked. Comments are ignored by the syntax.
###  2.1.4. Encoding declarations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations "Link to this heading")
If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches the regular expression `coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+)`, this comment is processed as an encoding declaration; the first group of this expression names the encoding of the source code file. The encoding declaration must appear on a line of its own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a comment-only line. The recommended forms of an encoding expression are
Copy```
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-

```

which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and
Copy```
# vim:fileencoding=<encoding-name>

```

which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar’s VIM.
If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is UTF-8. If the implicit or explicit encoding of a file is UTF-8, an initial UTF-8 byte-order mark (`b'\xef\xbb\xbf'`) is ignored rather than being a syntax error.
If an encoding is declared, the encoding name must be recognized by Python (see [Standard Encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings)). The encoding is used for all lexical analysis, including string literals, comments and identifiers.
###  2.1.5. Explicit line joining[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#explicit-line-joining "Link to this heading")
Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using backslash characters (`\`), as follows: when a physical line ends in a backslash that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the following end-of-line character. For example:
Copy```
if 1900 < year < 2100 and 1 <= month <= 12 \
   and 1 <= day <= 31 and 0 <= hour < 24 \
   and 0 <= minute < 60 and 0 <= second < 60:   # Looks like a valid date
        return 1

```

A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment. A backslash does not continue a comment. A backslash does not continue a token except for string literals (i.e., tokens other than string literals cannot be split across physical lines using a backslash). A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a line outside a string literal.
###  2.1.6. Implicit line joining[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#implicit-line-joining "Link to this heading")
Expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split over more than one physical line without using backslashes. For example:
Copy```
month_names = ['Januari', 'Februari', 'Maart',      # These are the
               'April',   'Mei',      'Juni',       # Dutch names
               'Juli',    'Augustus', 'September',  # for the months
               'Oktober', 'November', 'December']   # of the year

```

Implicitly continued lines can carry comments. The indentation of the continuation lines is not important. Blank continuation lines are allowed. There is no NEWLINE token between implicit continuation lines. Implicitly continued lines can also occur within triple-quoted strings (see below); in that case they cannot carry comments.
###  2.1.7. Blank lines[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#blank-lines "Link to this heading")
A logical line that contains only spaces, tabs, formfeeds and possibly a comment, is ignored (i.e., no NEWLINE token is generated). During interactive input of statements, handling of a blank line may differ depending on the implementation of the read-eval-print loop. In the standard interactive interpreter, an entirely blank logical line (i.e. one containing not even whitespace or a comment) terminates a multi-line statement.
###  2.1.8. Indentation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation "Link to this heading")
Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.
Tabs are replaced (from left to right) by one to eight spaces such that the total number of characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple of eight (this is intended to be the same rule as used by Unix). The total number of spaces preceding the first non-blank character then determines the line’s indentation. Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation.
Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in spaces; a [`TabError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TabError "TabError") is raised in that case.
**Cross-platform compatibility note:** because of the nature of text editors on non-UNIX platforms, it is unwise to use a mixture of spaces and tabs for the indentation in a single source file. It should also be noted that different platforms may explicitly limit the maximum indentation level.
A formfeed character may be present at the start of the line; it will be ignored for the indentation calculations above. Formfeed characters occurring elsewhere in the leading whitespace have an undefined effect (for instance, they may reset the space count to zero).
The indentation levels of consecutive lines are used to generate INDENT and DEDENT tokens, using a stack, as follows.
Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the stack; this will never be popped off again. The numbers pushed on the stack will always be strictly increasing from bottom to top. At the beginning of each logical line, the line’s indentation level is compared to the top of the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger, it is pushed on the stack, and one INDENT token is generated. If it is smaller, it _must_ be one of the numbers occurring on the stack; all numbers on the stack that are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT token is generated. At the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each number remaining on the stack that is larger than zero.
Here is an example of a correctly (though confusingly) indented piece of Python code:
Copy```
defperm(l):
        # Compute the list of all permutations of l
    if len(l) <= 1:
                  return [l]
    r = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
             s = l[:i] + l[i+1:]
             p = perm(s)
             for x in p:
              r.append(l[i:i+1] + x)
    return r

```

The following example shows various indentation errors:
Copy```
defperm(l):                       # error: first line indented
for i in range(len(l)):             # error: not indented
    s = l[:i] + l[i+1:]
        p = perm(l[:i] + l[i+1:])   # error: unexpected indent
        for x in p:
                r.append(l[i:i+1] + x)
            return r                # error: inconsistent dedent

```

(Actually, the first three errors are detected by the parser; only the last error is found by the lexical analyzer — the indentation of `return r` does not match a level popped off the stack.)
###  2.1.9. Whitespace between tokens[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#whitespace-between-tokens "Link to this heading")
Except at the beginning of a logical line or in string literals, the whitespace characters space, tab and formfeed can be used interchangeably to separate tokens. Whitespace is needed between two tokens only if their concatenation could otherwise be interpreted as a different token (e.g., ab is one token, but a b is two tokens).
##  2.2. Other tokens[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#other-tokens "Link to this heading")
Besides NEWLINE, INDENT and DEDENT, the following categories of tokens exist: _identifiers_ , _keywords_ , _literals_ , _operators_ , and _delimiters_. Whitespace characters (other than line terminators, discussed earlier) are not tokens, but serve to delimit tokens. Where ambiguity exists, a token comprises the longest possible string that forms a legal token, when read from left to right.
##  2.3. Identifiers and keywords[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers "Link to this heading")
Identifiers (also referred to as _names_) are described by the following lexical definitions.
The syntax of identifiers in Python is based on the Unicode standard annex UAX-31, with elaboration and changes as defined below; see also [**PEP 3131**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3131/) for further details.
Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F), the valid characters for identifiers include the uppercase and lowercase letters `A` through `Z`, the underscore `_` and, except for the first character, the digits `0` through `9`. Python 3.0 introduced additional characters from outside the ASCII range (see [**PEP 3131**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3131/)). For these characters, the classification uses the version of the Unicode Character Database as included in the [`unicodedata`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#module-unicodedata "unicodedata: Access the Unicode Database.") module.
Identifiers are unlimited in length. Case is significant.
```
**identifier**   ::= [xid_start](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-xid_start) [xid_continue](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-xid_continue)*
**id_start**     ::= <all characters in general categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Nl, the underscore, and characters with the Other_ID_Start property>
**id_continue**  ::= <all characters in [id_start](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-id_start), plus characters in the categories Mn, Mc, Nd, Pc and others with the Other_ID_Continue property>
**xid_start**    ::= <all characters in [id_start](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-id_start) whose NFKC normalization is in "id_start xid_continue*">
**xid_continue** ::= <all characters in [id_continue](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-id_continue) whose NFKC normalization is in "id_continue*">

```

The Unicode category codes mentioned above stand for:
  * _Lu_ - uppercase letters
  * _Ll_ - lowercase letters
  * _Lt_ - titlecase letters
  * _Lm_ - modifier letters
  * _Lo_ - other letters
  * _Nl_ - letter numbers
  * _Mn_ - nonspacing marks
  * _Mc_ - spacing combining marks
  * _Nd_ - decimal numbers
  * _Pc_ - connector punctuations
  * _Other_ID_Start_ - explicit list of characters in [PropList.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.1.0/ucd/PropList.txt) to support backwards compatibility
  * _Other_ID_Continue_ - likewise


All identifiers are converted into the normal form NFKC while parsing; comparison of identifiers is based on NFKC.
A non-normative HTML file listing all valid identifier characters for Unicode 15.1.0 can be found at <https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.1.0/ucd/DerivedCoreProperties.txt>
###  2.3.1. Keywords[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords "Link to this heading")
The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or _keywords_ of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here:
###  2.3.2. Soft Keywords[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.10.
Some identifiers are only reserved under specific contexts. These are known as _soft keywords_. The identifiers `match`, `case`, `type` and `_` can syntactically act as keywords in certain contexts, but this distinction is done at the parser level, not when tokenizing.
As soft keywords, their use in the grammar is possible while still preserving compatibility with existing code that uses these names as identifier names.
`match`, `case`, and `_` are used in the [`match`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match) statement. `type` is used in the [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement.
Changed in version 3.12: `type` is now a soft keyword.
###  2.3.3. Reserved classes of identifiers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#reserved-classes-of-identifiers "Link to this heading")
Certain classes of identifiers (besides keywords) have special meanings. These classes are identified by the patterns of leading and trailing underscore characters: 

`_*`
    
Not imported by `from module import *`. 

`_`
    
In a `case` pattern within a [`match`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match) statement, `_` is a [soft keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords) that denotes a [wildcard](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#wildcard-patterns).
Separately, the interactive interpreter makes the result of the last evaluation available in the variable `_`. (It is stored in the [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.") module, alongside built-in functions like `print`.)
Elsewhere, `_` is a regular identifier. It is often used to name “special” items, but it is not special to Python itself.
Note
The name `_` is often used in conjunction with internationalization; refer to the documentation for the [`gettext`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services.") module for more information on this convention.
It is also commonly used for unused variables. 

`__*__`
    
System-defined names, informally known as “dunder” names. These names are defined by the interpreter and its implementation (including the standard library). Current system names are discussed in the [Special method names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames) section and elsewhere. More will likely be defined in future versions of Python. _Any_ use of `__*__` names, in any context, that does not follow explicitly documented use, is subject to breakage without warning. 

`__*`
    
Class-private names. Names in this category, when used within the context of a class definition, are re-written to use a mangled form to help avoid name clashes between “private” attributes of base and derived classes. See section [Identifiers (Names)](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atom-identifiers).
##  2.4. Literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals "Link to this heading")
Literals are notations for constant values of some built-in types.
###  2.4.1. String and Bytes literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals "Link to this heading")
String literals are described by the following lexical definitions:
```
**stringliteral**   ::= [[stringprefix](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringprefix)]([shortstring](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortstring) | [longstring](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longstring))
**stringprefix**    ::= "r" | "u" | "R" | "U" | "f" | "F"
                    | "fr" | "Fr" | "fR" | "FR" | "rf" | "rF" | "Rf" | "RF"
**shortstring**     ::= "'" [shortstringitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortstringitem)* "'" | '"' [shortstringitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortstringitem)* '"'
**longstring**      ::= "'''" [longstringitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longstringitem)* "'''" | '"""' [longstringitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longstringitem)* '"""'
**shortstringitem** ::= [shortstringchar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortstringchar) | [stringescapeseq](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringescapeseq)
**longstringitem**  ::= [longstringchar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longstringchar) | [stringescapeseq](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringescapeseq)
**shortstringchar** ::= <any source character except "\" or newline or the quote>
**longstringchar**  ::= <any source character except "\">
**stringescapeseq** ::= "\" <any source character>

```
```
**bytesliteral**   ::= [bytesprefix](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bytesprefix)([shortbytes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortbytes) | [longbytes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longbytes))
**bytesprefix**    ::= "b" | "B" | "br" | "Br" | "bR" | "BR" | "rb" | "rB" | "Rb" | "RB"
**shortbytes**     ::= "'" [shortbytesitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortbytesitem)* "'" | '"' [shortbytesitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortbytesitem)* '"'
**longbytes**      ::= "'''" [longbytesitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longbytesitem)* "'''" | '"""' [longbytesitem](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longbytesitem)* '"""'
**shortbytesitem** ::= [shortbyteschar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shortbyteschar) | [bytesescapeseq](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bytesescapeseq)
**longbytesitem**  ::= [longbyteschar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-longbyteschar) | [bytesescapeseq](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bytesescapeseq)
**shortbyteschar** ::= <any ASCII character except "\" or newline or the quote>
**longbyteschar**  ::= <any ASCII character except "\">
**bytesescapeseq** ::= "\" <any ASCII character>

```

One syntactic restriction not indicated by these productions is that whitespace is not allowed between the [`stringprefix`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringprefix) or [`bytesprefix`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bytesprefix) and the rest of the literal. The source character set is defined by the encoding declaration; it is UTF-8 if no encoding declaration is given in the source file; see section [Encoding declarations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encodings).
In plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). They can also be enclosed in matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally referred to as _triple-quoted strings_). The backslash (`\`) character is used to give special meaning to otherwise ordinary characters like `n`, which means ‘newline’ when escaped (`\n`). It can also be used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character. See [escape sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences) below for examples.
Bytes literals are always prefixed with `'b'` or `'B'`; they produce an instance of the [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") type instead of the [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") type. They may only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater must be expressed with escapes.
Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter `'r'` or `'R'`; such constructs are called _raw string literals_ and _raw bytes literals_ respectively and treat backslashes as literal characters. As a result, in raw string literals, `'\U'` and `'\u'` escapes are not treated specially.
Added in version 3.3: The `'rb'` prefix of raw bytes literals has been added as a synonym of `'br'`.
Support for the unicode legacy literal (`u'value'`) was reintroduced to simplify the maintenance of dual Python 2.x and 3.x codebases. See [**PEP 414**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0414/) for more information.
A string literal with `'f'` or `'F'` in its prefix is a _formatted string literal_ ; see [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings). The `'f'` may be combined with `'r'`, but not with `'b'` or `'u'`, therefore raw formatted strings are possible, but formatted bytes literals are not.
In triple-quoted literals, unescaped newlines and quotes are allowed (and are retained), except that three unescaped quotes in a row terminate the literal. (A “quote” is the character used to open the literal, i.e. either `'` or `"`.)
####  2.4.1.1. Escape sequences[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences "Link to this heading")
Unless an `'r'` or `'R'` prefix is present, escape sequences in string and bytes literals are interpreted according to rules similar to those used by Standard C. The recognized escape sequences are:
Escape Sequence | Meaning | Notes  
---|---|---  
`\`<newline> | Backslash and newline ignored | (1)  
`\\` | Backslash (`\`) |   
`\'` | Single quote (`'`) |   
`\"` | Double quote (`"`) |   
`\a` | ASCII Bell (BEL) |   
`\b` | ASCII Backspace (BS) |   
`\f` | ASCII Formfeed (FF) |   
`\n` | ASCII Linefeed (LF) |   
`\r` | ASCII Carriage Return (CR) |   
`\t` | ASCII Horizontal Tab (TAB) |   
`\v` | ASCII Vertical Tab (VT) |   
`\_ooo_`|  Character with octal value _ooo_ | (2,4)  
`\x_hh_`|  Character with hex value _hh_ | (3,4)  
Escape sequences only recognized in string literals are:
Escape Sequence | Meaning | Notes  
---|---|---  
`\N{_name_}`|  Character named _name_ in the Unicode database | (5)  
`\u_xxxx_`|  Character with 16-bit hex value _xxxx_ | (6)  
`\U_xxxxxxxx_`|  Character with 32-bit hex value _xxxxxxxx_ | (7)  
Notes:
  1. A backslash can be added at the end of a line to ignore the newline:
Copy```
>>> 'This string will not include \
... backslashes or newline characters.'
'This string will not include backslashes or newline characters.'

```

The same result can be achieved using [triple-quoted strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#strings), or parentheses and [string literal concatenation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-concatenation).
  2. As in Standard C, up to three octal digits are accepted.
Changed in version 3.11: Octal escapes with value larger than `0o377` produce a [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning").
Changed in version 3.12: Octal escapes with value larger than `0o377` produce a [`SyntaxWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning "SyntaxWarning"). In a future Python version they will be eventually a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError").
  3. Unlike in Standard C, exactly two hex digits are required.
  4. In a bytes literal, hexadecimal and octal escapes denote the byte with the given value. In a string literal, these escapes denote a Unicode character with the given value.
  5. Changed in version 3.3: Support for name aliases [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#id16) has been added.
  6. Exactly four hex digits are required.
  7. Any Unicode character can be encoded this way. Exactly eight hex digits are required.


Unlike Standard C, all unrecognized escape sequences are left in the string unchanged, i.e., _the backslash is left in the result_. (This behavior is useful when debugging: if an escape sequence is mistyped, the resulting output is more easily recognized as broken.) It is also important to note that the escape sequences only recognized in string literals fall into the category of unrecognized escapes for bytes literals.
Changed in version 3.6: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning").
Changed in version 3.12: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a [`SyntaxWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning "SyntaxWarning"). In a future Python version they will be eventually a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError").
Even in a raw literal, quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the result; for example, `r"\""` is a valid string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; `r"\"` is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes). Specifically, _a raw literal cannot end in a single backslash_ (since the backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part of the literal, _not_ as a line continuation.
###  2.4.2. String literal concatenation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literal-concatenation "Link to this heading")
Multiple adjacent string or bytes literals (delimited by whitespace), possibly using different quoting conventions, are allowed, and their meaning is the same as their concatenation. Thus, `"hello" 'world'` is equivalent to `"helloworld"`. This feature can be used to reduce the number of backslashes needed, to split long strings conveniently across long lines, or even to add comments to parts of strings, for example:
Copy```
re.compile("[A-Za-z_]"       # letter or underscore
           "[A-Za-z0-9_]*"   # letter, digit or underscore
          )

```

Note that this feature is defined at the syntactical level, but implemented at compile time. The ‘+’ operator must be used to concatenate string expressions at run time. Also note that literal concatenation can use different quoting styles for each component (even mixing raw strings and triple quoted strings), and formatted string literals may be concatenated with plain string literals.
###  2.4.3. f-strings[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#formatted-string-literals "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.6.
A _formatted string literal_ or _f-string_ is a string literal that is prefixed with `'f'` or `'F'`. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces `{}`. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.
Escape sequences are decoded like in ordinary string literals (except when a literal is also marked as a raw string). After decoding, the grammar for the contents of the string is:
```
**f_string**          ::= ([literal_char](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-literal_char) | "{{" | "}}" | [replacement_field](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-replacement_field))*

```

The parts of the string outside curly braces are treated literally, except that any doubled curly braces `'{{'` or `'}}'` are replaced with the corresponding single curly brace. A single opening curly bracket `'{'` marks a replacement field, which starts with a Python expression. To display both the expression text and its value after evaluation, (useful in debugging), an equal sign `'='` may be added after the expression. A conversion field, introduced by an exclamation point `'!'` may follow. A format specifier may also be appended, introduced by a colon `':'`. A replacement field ends with a closing curly bracket `'}'`.
Expressions in formatted string literals are treated like regular Python expressions surrounded by parentheses, with a few exceptions. An empty expression is not allowed, and both [`lambda`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) and assignment expressions `:=` must be surrounded by explicit parentheses. Each expression is evaluated in the context where the formatted string literal appears, in order from left to right. Replacement expressions can contain newlines in both single-quoted and triple-quoted f-strings and they can contain comments. Everything that comes after a `#` inside a replacement field is a comment (even closing braces and quotes). In that case, replacement fields must be closed in a different line.
Changed in version 3.7: Prior to Python 3.7, an [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await) expression and comprehensions containing an [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) clause were illegal in the expressions in formatted string literals due to a problem with the implementation.
Changed in version 3.12: Prior to Python 3.12, comments were not allowed inside f-string replacement fields.
When the equal sign `'='` is provided, the output will have the expression text, the `'='` and the evaluated value. Spaces after the opening brace `'{'`, within the expression and after the `'='` are all retained in the output. By default, the `'='` causes the [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") of the expression to be provided, unless there is a format specified. When a format is specified it defaults to the [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") of the expression unless a conversion `'!r'` is declared.
Added in version 3.8: The equal sign `'='`.
If a conversion is specified, the result of evaluating the expression is converted before formatting. Conversion `'!s'` calls [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") on the result, `'!r'` calls [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr"), and `'!a'` calls [`ascii()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ascii "ascii").
The result is then formatted using the [`format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format "format") protocol. The format specifier is passed to the [`__format__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__format__ "object.__format__") method of the expression or conversion result. An empty string is passed when the format specifier is omitted. The formatted result is then included in the final value of the whole string.
Top-level format specifiers may include nested replacement fields. These nested fields may include their own conversion fields and [format specifiers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec), but may not include more deeply nested replacement fields. The [format specifier mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) is the same as that used by the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method.
Formatted string literals may be concatenated, but replacement fields cannot be split across literals.
Some examples of formatted string literals:
Copy```
>>> name = "Fred"
>>> f"He said his name is {name!r}."
"He said his name is 'Fred'."
>>> f"He said his name is {repr(name)}."  # repr() is equivalent to !r
"He said his name is 'Fred'."
>>> width = 10
>>> precision = 4
>>> value = decimal.Decimal("12.34567")
>>> f"result: {value:{width}.{precision}}"  # nested fields
'result:      12.35'
>>> today = datetime(year=2017, month=1, day=27)
>>> f"{today:%B %d, %Y}"  # using date format specifier
'January 27, 2017'
>>> f"{today=:%B %d, %Y}" # using date format specifier and debugging
'today=January 27, 2017'
>>> number = 1024
>>> f"{number:#0x}"  # using integer format specifier
'0x400'
>>> foo = "bar"
>>> f"{foo= }" # preserves whitespace
" foo = 'bar'"
>>> line = "The mill's closed"
>>> f"{line= }"
'line = "The mill\'s closed"'
>>> f"{line= :20}"
"line = The mill's closed   "
>>> f"{line= !r:20}"
'line = "The mill\'s closed" '

```

Reusing the outer f-string quoting type inside a replacement field is permitted:
Copy```
>>> a = dict(x=2)
>>> f"abc {a["x"]} def"
'abc 2 def'

```

Changed in version 3.12: Prior to Python 3.12, reuse of the same quoting type of the outer f-string inside a replacement field was not possible.
Backslashes are also allowed in replacement fields and are evaluated the same way as in any other context:
Copy```
>>> a = ["a", "b", "c"]
>>> print(f"List a contains:\n{"\n".join(a)}")
List a contains:
a
b
c

```

Changed in version 3.12: Prior to Python 3.12, backslashes were not permitted inside an f-string replacement field.
Formatted string literals cannot be used as docstrings, even if they do not include expressions.
Copy```
>>> deffoo():
...     f"Not a docstring"
...
>>> foo.__doc__ is None
True

```

See also [**PEP 498**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/) for the proposal that added formatted string literals, and [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format"), which uses a related format string mechanism.
###  2.4.4. Numeric literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#numeric-literals "Link to this heading")
There are three types of numeric literals: integers, floating-point numbers, and imaginary numbers. There are no complex literals (complex numbers can be formed by adding a real number and an imaginary number).
Note that numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like `-1` is actually an expression composed of the unary operator ‘`-`’ and the literal `1`.
###  2.4.5. Integer literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals "Link to this heading")
Integer literals are described by the following lexical definitions:
```
**integer**      ::= [decinteger](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-decinteger) | [bininteger](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bininteger) | [octinteger](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-octinteger) | [hexinteger](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-hexinteger)
**decinteger**   ::= [nonzerodigit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-nonzerodigit) (["_"] [digit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digit))* | "0"+ (["_"] "0")*
**bininteger**   ::= "0" ("b" | "B") (["_"] [bindigit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bindigit))+
**octinteger**   ::= "0" ("o" | "O") (["_"] [octdigit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-octdigit))+
**hexinteger**   ::= "0" ("x" | "X") (["_"] [hexdigit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-hexdigit))+
**nonzerodigit** ::= "1"..."9"
**digit**        ::= "0"..."9"
**bindigit**     ::= "0" | "1"
**octdigit**     ::= "0"..."7"
**hexdigit**     ::= [digit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digit) | "a"..."f" | "A"..."F"

```

There is no limit for the length of integer literals apart from what can be stored in available memory.
Underscores are ignored for determining the numeric value of the literal. They can be used to group digits for enhanced readability. One underscore can occur between digits, and after base specifiers like `0x`.
Note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed. This is for disambiguation with C-style octal literals, which Python used before version 3.0.
Some examples of integer literals:
Copy```
7     2147483647                        0o177    0b100110111
3     79228162514264337593543950336     0o377    0xdeadbeef
      100_000_000_000                   0b_1110_0101

```

Changed in version 3.6: Underscores are now allowed for grouping purposes in literals.
###  2.4.6. Floating-point literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#floating-point-literals "Link to this heading")
Floating-point literals are described by the following lexical definitions:
```
**floatnumber**   ::= [pointfloat](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pointfloat) | [exponentfloat](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-exponentfloat)
**pointfloat**    ::= [[digitpart](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digitpart)] [fraction](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-fraction) | [digitpart](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digitpart) "."
**exponentfloat** ::= ([digitpart](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digitpart) | [pointfloat](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-pointfloat)) [exponent](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-exponent)
**digitpart**     ::= [digit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digit) (["_"] [digit](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digit))*
**fraction**      ::= "." [digitpart](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digitpart)
**exponent**      ::= ("e" | "E") ["+" | "-"] [digitpart](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digitpart)

```

Note that the integer and exponent parts are always interpreted using radix 10. For example, `077e010` is legal, and denotes the same number as `77e10`. The allowed range of floating-point literals is implementation-dependent. As in integer literals, underscores are supported for digit grouping.
Some examples of floating-point literals:
Copy```
3.14    10.    .001    1e100    3.14e-10    0e0    3.14_15_93

```

Changed in version 3.6: Underscores are now allowed for grouping purposes in literals.
###  2.4.7. Imaginary literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#imaginary-literals "Link to this heading")
Imaginary literals are described by the following lexical definitions:
```
**imagnumber** ::= ([floatnumber](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-floatnumber) | [digitpart](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-digitpart)) ("j" | "J")

```

An imaginary literal yields a complex number with a real part of 0.0. Complex numbers are represented as a pair of floating-point numbers and have the same restrictions on their range. To create a complex number with a nonzero real part, add a floating-point number to it, e.g., `(3+4j)`. Some examples of imaginary literals:
Copy```
3.14j   10.j    10j     .001j   1e100j   3.14e-10j   3.14_15_93j

```

##  2.5. Operators[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#operators "Link to this heading")
The following tokens are operators:
##  2.6. Delimiters[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#delimiters "Link to this heading")
The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:
The period can also occur in floating-point and imaginary literals. A sequence of three periods has a special meaning as an ellipsis literal. The second half of the list, the augmented assignment operators, serve lexically as delimiters, but also perform an operation.
The following printing ASCII characters have special meaning as part of other tokens or are otherwise significant to the lexical analyzer:
The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:

#  6. Expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expressions "Link to this heading")
This chapter explains the meaning of the elements of expressions in Python.
**Syntax Notes:** In this and the following chapters, extended BNF notation will be used to describe syntax, not lexical analysis. When (one alternative of) a syntax rule has the form
```
**name** ::= othername

```

and no semantics are given, the semantics of this form of `name` are the same as for `othername`.
##  6.1. Arithmetic conversions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#arithmetic-conversions "Link to this heading")
When a description of an arithmetic operator below uses the phrase “the numeric arguments are converted to a common type”, this means that the operator implementation for built-in types works as follows:
  * If either argument is a complex number, the other is converted to complex;
  * otherwise, if either argument is a floating-point number, the other is converted to floating point;
  * otherwise, both must be integers and no conversion is necessary.


Some additional rules apply for certain operators (e.g., a string as a left argument to the ‘%’ operator). Extensions must define their own conversion behavior.
##  6.2. Atoms[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atoms "Link to this heading")
Atoms are the most basic elements of expressions. The simplest atoms are identifiers or literals. Forms enclosed in parentheses, brackets or braces are also categorized syntactically as atoms. The syntax for atoms is:
```
**atom**      ::= [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) | [literal](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-literal) | [enclosure](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-enclosure)
**enclosure** ::= [parenth_form](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-parenth_form) | [list_display](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-list_display) | [dict_display](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-dict_display) | [set_display](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-set_display)
              | [generator_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-generator_expression) | [yield_atom](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_atom)

```

###  6.2.1. Identifiers (Names)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atom-identifiers "Link to this heading")
An identifier occurring as an atom is a name. See section [Identifiers and keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers) for lexical definition and section [Naming and binding](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming) for documentation of naming and binding.
When the name is bound to an object, evaluation of the atom yields that object. When a name is not bound, an attempt to evaluate it raises a [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError") exception.
####  6.2.1.1. Private name mangling[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#index-5 "Link to this heading")
When an identifier that textually occurs in a class definition begins with two or more underscore characters and does not end in two or more underscores, it is considered a _private name_ of that class.
See also
The [class specifications](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class).
More precisely, private names are transformed to a longer form before code is generated for them. If the transformed name is longer than 255 characters, implementation-defined truncation may happen.
The transformation is independent of the syntactical context in which the identifier is used but only the following private identifiers are mangled:
  * Any name used as the name of a variable that is assigned or read or any name of an attribute being accessed.
The [`__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__name__ "definition.__name__") attribute of nested functions, classes, and type aliases is however not mangled.
  * The name of imported modules, e.g., `__spam` in `import __spam`. If the module is part of a package (i.e., its name contains a dot), the name is _not_ mangled, e.g., the `__foo` in `import __foo.bar` is not mangled.
  * The name of an imported member, e.g., `__f` in `from spam import __f`.


The transformation rule is defined as follows:
  * The class name, with leading underscores removed and a single leading underscore inserted, is inserted in front of the identifier, e.g., the identifier `__spam` occurring in a class named `Foo`, `_Foo` or `__Foo` is transformed to `_Foo__spam`.
  * If the class name consists only of underscores, the transformation is the identity, e.g., the identifier `__spam` occurring in a class named `_` or `__` is left as is.


###  6.2.2. Literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#literals "Link to this heading")
Python supports string and bytes literals and various numeric literals:
```
**literal** ::= [stringliteral](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringliteral) | [bytesliteral](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-bytesliteral)
            | [integer](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-integer) | [floatnumber](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-floatnumber) | [imagnumber](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-imagnumber)

```

Evaluation of a literal yields an object of the given type (string, bytes, integer, floating-point number, complex number) with the given value. The value may be approximated in the case of floating-point and imaginary (complex) literals. See section [Literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals) for details.
All literals correspond to immutable data types, and hence the object’s identity is less important than its value. Multiple evaluations of literals with the same value (either the same occurrence in the program text or a different occurrence) may obtain the same object or a different object with the same value.
###  6.2.3. Parenthesized forms[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#parenthesized-forms "Link to this heading")
A parenthesized form is an optional expression list enclosed in parentheses:
```
**parenth_form** ::= "(" [[starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression)] ")"

```

A parenthesized expression list yields whatever that expression list yields: if the list contains at least one comma, it yields a tuple; otherwise, it yields the single expression that makes up the expression list.
An empty pair of parentheses yields an empty tuple object. Since tuples are immutable, the same rules as for literals apply (i.e., two occurrences of the empty tuple may or may not yield the same object).
Note that tuples are not formed by the parentheses, but rather by use of the comma. The exception is the empty tuple, for which parentheses _are_ required — allowing unparenthesized “nothing” in expressions would cause ambiguities and allow common typos to pass uncaught.
###  6.2.4. Displays for lists, sets and dictionaries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#displays-for-lists-sets-and-dictionaries "Link to this heading")
For constructing a list, a set or a dictionary Python provides special syntax called “displays”, each of them in two flavors:
  * either the container contents are listed explicitly, or
  * they are computed via a set of looping and filtering instructions, called a _comprehension_.


Common syntax elements for comprehensions are:
```
**comprehension** ::= [assignment_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) [comp_for](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_for)
**comp_for**      ::= ["async"] "for" [target_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target_list) "in" [or_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_test) [[comp_iter](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_iter)]
**comp_iter**     ::= [comp_for](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_for) | [comp_if](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_if)
**comp_if**       ::= "if" [or_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_test) [[comp_iter](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_iter)]

```

The comprehension consists of a single expression followed by at least one `for` clause and zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. In this case, the elements of the new container are those that would be produced by considering each of the `for` or `if` clauses a block, nesting from left to right, and evaluating the expression to produce an element each time the innermost block is reached.
However, aside from the iterable expression in the leftmost `for` clause, the comprehension is executed in a separate implicitly nested scope. This ensures that names assigned to in the target list don’t “leak” into the enclosing scope.
The iterable expression in the leftmost `for` clause is evaluated directly in the enclosing scope and then passed as an argument to the implicitly nested scope. Subsequent `for` clauses and any filter condition in the leftmost `for` clause cannot be evaluated in the enclosing scope as they may depend on the values obtained from the leftmost iterable. For example: `[x*y for x in range(10) for y in range(x, x+10)]`.
To ensure the comprehension always results in a container of the appropriate type, `yield` and `yield from` expressions are prohibited in the implicitly nested scope.
Since Python 3.6, in an [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) function, an `async for` clause may be used to iterate over a [asynchronous iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator). A comprehension in an `async def` function may consist of either a `for` or `async for` clause following the leading expression, may contain additional `for` or `async for` clauses, and may also use [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await) expressions.
If a comprehension contains `async for` clauses, or if it contains `await` expressions or other asynchronous comprehensions anywhere except the iterable expression in the leftmost `for` clause, it is called an _asynchronous comprehension_. An asynchronous comprehension may suspend the execution of the coroutine function in which it appears. See also [**PEP 530**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/).
Added in version 3.6: Asynchronous comprehensions were introduced.
Changed in version 3.8: `yield` and `yield from` prohibited in the implicitly nested scope.
Changed in version 3.11: Asynchronous comprehensions are now allowed inside comprehensions in asynchronous functions. Outer comprehensions implicitly become asynchronous.
###  6.2.5. List displays[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#list-displays "Link to this heading")
A list display is a possibly empty series of expressions enclosed in square brackets:
```
**list_display** ::= "[" [[flexible_expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-flexible_expression_list) | [comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comprehension)] "]"

```

A list display yields a new list object, the contents being specified by either a list of expressions or a comprehension. When a comma-separated list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from left to right and placed into the list object in that order. When a comprehension is supplied, the list is constructed from the elements resulting from the comprehension.
###  6.2.6. Set displays[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#set-displays "Link to this heading")
A set display is denoted by curly braces and distinguishable from dictionary displays by the lack of colons separating keys and values:
```
**set_display** ::= "{" ([flexible_expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-flexible_expression_list) | [comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comprehension)) "}"

```

A set display yields a new mutable set object, the contents being specified by either a sequence of expressions or a comprehension. When a comma-separated list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from left to right and added to the set object. When a comprehension is supplied, the set is constructed from the elements resulting from the comprehension.
An empty set cannot be constructed with `{}`; this literal constructs an empty dictionary.
###  6.2.7. Dictionary displays[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dictionary-displays "Link to this heading")
A dictionary display is a possibly empty series of dict items (key/value pairs) enclosed in curly braces:
```
**dict_display**       ::= "{" [[dict_item_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-dict_item_list) | [dict_comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-dict_comprehension)] "}"
**dict_item_list**     ::= [dict_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-dict_item) ("," [dict_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-dict_item))* [","]
**dict_item**          ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ":" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) | "**" [or_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_expr)
**dict_comprehension** ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ":" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) [comp_for](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_for)

```

A dictionary display yields a new dictionary object.
If a comma-separated sequence of dict items is given, they are evaluated from left to right to define the entries of the dictionary: each key object is used as a key into the dictionary to store the corresponding value. This means that you can specify the same key multiple times in the dict item list, and the final dictionary’s value for that key will be the last one given.
A double asterisk `**` denotes _dictionary unpacking_. Its operand must be a [mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping). Each mapping item is added to the new dictionary. Later values replace values already set by earlier dict items and earlier dictionary unpackings.
Added in version 3.5: Unpacking into dictionary displays, originally proposed by [**PEP 448**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0448/).
A dict comprehension, in contrast to list and set comprehensions, needs two expressions separated with a colon followed by the usual “for” and “if” clauses. When the comprehension is run, the resulting key and value elements are inserted in the new dictionary in the order they are produced.
Restrictions on the types of the key values are listed earlier in section [The standard type hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types). (To summarize, the key type should be [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable), which excludes all mutable objects.) Clashes between duplicate keys are not detected; the last value (textually rightmost in the display) stored for a given key value prevails.
Changed in version 3.8: Prior to Python 3.8, in dict comprehensions, the evaluation order of key and value was not well-defined. In CPython, the value was evaluated before the key. Starting with 3.8, the key is evaluated before the value, as proposed by [**PEP 572**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/).
###  6.2.8. Generator expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions "Link to this heading")
A generator expression is a compact generator notation in parentheses:
```
**generator_expression** ::= "(" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) [comp_for](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_for) ")"

```

A generator expression yields a new generator object. Its syntax is the same as for comprehensions, except that it is enclosed in parentheses instead of brackets or curly braces.
Variables used in the generator expression are evaluated lazily when the [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.__next__ "generator.__next__") method is called for the generator object (in the same fashion as normal generators). However, the iterable expression in the leftmost `for` clause is immediately evaluated, and the [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator) is immediately created for that iterable, so that an error produced while creating the iterator will be emitted at the point where the generator expression is defined, rather than at the point where the first value is retrieved. Subsequent `for` clauses and any filter condition in the leftmost `for` clause cannot be evaluated in the enclosing scope as they may depend on the values obtained from the leftmost iterable. For example: `(x*y for x in range(10) for y in range(x, x+10))`.
The parentheses can be omitted on calls with only one argument. See section [Calls](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls) for details.
To avoid interfering with the expected operation of the generator expression itself, `yield` and `yield from` expressions are prohibited in the implicitly defined generator.
If a generator expression contains either `async for` clauses or [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await) expressions it is called an _asynchronous generator expression_. An asynchronous generator expression returns a new asynchronous generator object, which is an asynchronous iterator (see [Asynchronous Iterators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#async-iterators)).
Added in version 3.6: Asynchronous generator expressions were introduced.
Changed in version 3.7: Prior to Python 3.7, asynchronous generator expressions could only appear in [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) coroutines. Starting with 3.7, any function can use asynchronous generator expressions.
Changed in version 3.8: `yield` and `yield from` prohibited in the implicitly nested scope.
###  6.2.9. Yield expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yield-expressions "Link to this heading")
```
**yield_atom**       ::= "(" [yield_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_expression) ")"
**yield_from**       ::= "yield" "from" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)
**yield_expression** ::= "yield" [yield_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_list) | [yield_from](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_from)

```

The yield expression is used when defining a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) function or an [asynchronous generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-generator) function and thus can only be used in the body of a function definition. Using a yield expression in a function’s body causes that function to be a generator function, and using it in an [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) function’s body causes that coroutine function to be an asynchronous generator function. For example:
Copy```
defgen():  # defines a generator function
    yield 123

async defagen(): # defines an asynchronous generator function
    yield 123

```

Due to their side effects on the containing scope, `yield` expressions are not permitted as part of the implicitly defined scopes used to implement comprehensions and generator expressions.
Changed in version 3.8: Yield expressions prohibited in the implicitly nested scopes used to implement comprehensions and generator expressions.
Generator functions are described below, while asynchronous generator functions are described separately in section [Asynchronous generator functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#asynchronous-generator-functions).
When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator known as a generator. That generator then controls the execution of the generator function. The execution starts when one of the generator’s methods is called. At that time, the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, where it is suspended again, returning the value of [`yield_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_list) to the generator’s caller, or `None` if [`yield_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_list) is omitted. By suspended, we mean that all local state is retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and the state of any exception handling. When the execution is resumed by calling one of the generator’s methods, the function can proceed exactly as if the yield expression were just another external call. The value of the yield expression after resuming depends on the method which resumed the execution. If [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.__next__ "generator.__next__") is used (typically via either a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) or the [`next()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next "next") builtin) then the result is [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None"). Otherwise, if [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") is used, then the result will be the value passed in to that method.
All of this makes generator functions quite similar to coroutines; they yield multiple times, they have more than one entry point and their execution can be suspended. The only difference is that a generator function cannot control where the execution should continue after it yields; the control is always transferred to the generator’s caller.
Yield expressions are allowed anywhere in a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) construct. If the generator is not resumed before it is finalized (by reaching a zero reference count or by being garbage collected), the generator-iterator’s [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close") method will be called, allowing any pending [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clauses to execute.
When `yield from <expr>` is used, the supplied expression must be an iterable. The values produced by iterating that iterable are passed directly to the caller of the current generator’s methods. Any values passed in with [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") and any exceptions passed in with [`throw()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.throw "generator.throw") are passed to the underlying iterator if it has the appropriate methods. If this is not the case, then [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") will raise [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") or [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"), while [`throw()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.throw "generator.throw") will just raise the passed in exception immediately.
When the underlying iterator is complete, the [`value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration.value "StopIteration.value") attribute of the raised [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") instance becomes the value of the yield expression. It can be either set explicitly when raising [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"), or automatically when the subiterator is a generator (by returning a value from the subgenerator).
Changed in version 3.3: Added `yield from <expr>` to delegate control flow to a subiterator.
The parentheses may be omitted when the yield expression is the sole expression on the right hand side of an assignment statement.

####  6.2.9.1. Generator-iterator methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-iterator-methods "Link to this heading")
This subsection describes the methods of a generator iterator. They can be used to control the execution of a generator function.
Note that calling any of the generator methods below when the generator is already executing raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") exception. 

generator.__next__()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.__next__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Starts the execution of a generator function or resumes it at the last executed yield expression. When a generator function is resumed with a [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.__next__ "generator.__next__") method, the current yield expression always evaluates to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None"). The execution then continues to the next yield expression, where the generator is suspended again, and the value of the [`yield_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_list) is returned to [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.__next__ "generator.__next__")’s caller. If the generator exits without yielding another value, a [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception is raised.
This method is normally called implicitly, e.g. by a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) loop, or by the built-in [`next()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next "next") function. 

generator.send(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "Link to this definition") 
    
Resumes the execution and “sends” a value into the generator function. The _value_ argument becomes the result of the current yield expression. The [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") method returns the next value yielded by the generator, or raises [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") if the generator exits without yielding another value. When [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") is called to start the generator, it must be called with [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") as the argument, because there is no yield expression that could receive the value. 

generator.throw(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.throw "Link to this definition") 


generator.throw(_type_[, _value_[, _traceback_]]) 
    
Raises an exception at the point where the generator was paused, and returns the next value yielded by the generator function. If the generator exits without yielding another value, a [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception is raised. If the generator function does not catch the passed-in exception, or raises a different exception, then that exception propagates to the caller.
In typical use, this is called with a single exception instance similar to the way the [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) keyword is used.
For backwards compatibility, however, the second signature is supported, following a convention from older versions of Python. The _type_ argument should be an exception class, and _value_ should be an exception instance. If the _value_ is not provided, the _type_ constructor is called to get an instance. If _traceback_ is provided, it is set on the exception, otherwise any existing [`__traceback__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__traceback__ "BaseException.__traceback__") attribute stored in _value_ may be cleared.
Changed in version 3.12: The second signature (type[, value[, traceback]]) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Python. 

generator.close()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "Link to this definition") 
    
Raises a [`GeneratorExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#GeneratorExit "GeneratorExit") exception at the point where the generator function was paused (equivalent to calling `throw(GeneratorExit)`). The exception is raised by the yield expression where the generator was paused. If the generator function catches the exception and returns a value, this value is returned from [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close"). If the generator function is already closed, or raises [`GeneratorExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#GeneratorExit "GeneratorExit") (by not catching the exception), [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close") returns [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None"). If the generator yields a value, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised. If the generator raises any other exception, it is propagated to the caller. If the generator has already exited due to an exception or normal exit, [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close") returns [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") and has no other effect.
Changed in version 3.13: If a generator returns a value upon being closed, the value is returned by [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close").
####  6.2.9.2. Examples[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#examples "Link to this heading")
Here is a simple example that demonstrates the behavior of generators and generator functions:
Copy```
>>> defecho(value=None):
...     print("Execution starts when 'next()' is called for the first time.")
...     try:
...         while True:
...             try:
...                 value = (yield value)
...             except Exception as e:
...                 value = e
...     finally:
...         print("Don't forget to clean up when 'close()' is called.")
...
>>> generator = echo(1)
>>> print(next(generator))
Execution starts when 'next()' is called for the first time.
1
>>> print(next(generator))
None
>>> print(generator.send(2))
2
>>> generator.throw(TypeError, "spam")
TypeError('spam',)
>>> generator.close()
Don't forget to clean up when 'close()' is called.

```

For examples using `yield from`, see [PEP 380: Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-380) in “What’s New in Python.”
####  6.2.9.3. Asynchronous generator functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#asynchronous-generator-functions "Link to this heading")
The presence of a yield expression in a function or method defined using [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) further defines the function as an [asynchronous generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-generator) function.
When an asynchronous generator function is called, it returns an asynchronous iterator known as an asynchronous generator object. That object then controls the execution of the generator function. An asynchronous generator object is typically used in an [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) statement in a coroutine function analogously to how a generator object would be used in a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement.
Calling one of the asynchronous generator’s methods returns an [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) object, and the execution starts when this object is awaited on. At that time, the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, where it is suspended again, returning the value of [`yield_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_list) to the awaiting coroutine. As with a generator, suspension means that all local state is retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and the state of any exception handling. When the execution is resumed by awaiting on the next object returned by the asynchronous generator’s methods, the function can proceed exactly as if the yield expression were just another external call. The value of the yield expression after resuming depends on the method which resumed the execution. If [`__anext__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.__anext__ "agen.__anext__") is used then the result is [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None"). Otherwise, if [`asend()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.asend "agen.asend") is used, then the result will be the value passed in to that method.
If an asynchronous generator happens to exit early by [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), the caller task being cancelled, or other exceptions, the generator’s async cleanup code will run and possibly raise exceptions or access context variables in an unexpected context–perhaps after the lifetime of tasks it depends, or during the event loop shutdown when the async-generator garbage collection hook is called. To prevent this, the caller must explicitly close the async generator by calling [`aclose()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.aclose "agen.aclose") method to finalize the generator and ultimately detach it from the event loop.
In an asynchronous generator function, yield expressions are allowed anywhere in a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) construct. However, if an asynchronous generator is not resumed before it is finalized (by reaching a zero reference count or by being garbage collected), then a yield expression within a `try` construct could result in a failure to execute pending [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clauses. In this case, it is the responsibility of the event loop or scheduler running the asynchronous generator to call the asynchronous generator-iterator’s [`aclose()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.aclose "agen.aclose") method and run the resulting coroutine object, thus allowing any pending `finally` clauses to execute.
To take care of finalization upon event loop termination, an event loop should define a _finalizer_ function which takes an asynchronous generator-iterator and presumably calls [`aclose()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.aclose "agen.aclose") and executes the coroutine. This _finalizer_ may be registered by calling [`sys.set_asyncgen_hooks()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.set_asyncgen_hooks "sys.set_asyncgen_hooks"). When first iterated over, an asynchronous generator-iterator will store the registered _finalizer_ to be called upon finalization. For a reference example of a _finalizer_ method see the implementation of `asyncio.Loop.shutdown_asyncgens` in [Lib/asyncio/base_events.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py).
The expression `yield from <expr>` is a syntax error when used in an asynchronous generator function.
####  6.2.9.4. Asynchronous generator-iterator methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#asynchronous-generator-iterator-methods "Link to this heading")
This subsection describes the methods of an asynchronous generator iterator, which are used to control the execution of a generator function. 

_async_ agen.__anext__()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.__anext__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Returns an awaitable which when run starts to execute the asynchronous generator or resumes it at the last executed yield expression. When an asynchronous generator function is resumed with an [`__anext__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.__anext__ "agen.__anext__") method, the current yield expression always evaluates to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") in the returned awaitable, which when run will continue to the next yield expression. The value of the [`yield_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_list) of the yield expression is the value of the [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception raised by the completing coroutine. If the asynchronous generator exits without yielding another value, the awaitable instead raises a [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") exception, signalling that the asynchronous iteration has completed.
This method is normally called implicitly by a [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) loop. 

_async_ agen.asend(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.asend "Link to this definition") 
    
Returns an awaitable which when run resumes the execution of the asynchronous generator. As with the [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") method for a generator, this “sends” a value into the asynchronous generator function, and the _value_ argument becomes the result of the current yield expression. The awaitable returned by the [`asend()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.asend "agen.asend") method will return the next value yielded by the generator as the value of the raised [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"), or raises [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") if the asynchronous generator exits without yielding another value. When [`asend()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.asend "agen.asend") is called to start the asynchronous generator, it must be called with [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") as the argument, because there is no yield expression that could receive the value. 

_async_ agen.athrow(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.athrow "Link to this definition") 


_async_ agen.athrow(_type_[, _value_[, _traceback_]]) 
    
Returns an awaitable that raises an exception of type `type` at the point where the asynchronous generator was paused, and returns the next value yielded by the generator function as the value of the raised [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception. If the asynchronous generator exits without yielding another value, a [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") exception is raised by the awaitable. If the generator function does not catch the passed-in exception, or raises a different exception, then when the awaitable is run that exception propagates to the caller of the awaitable.
Changed in version 3.12: The second signature (type[, value[, traceback]]) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Python. 

_async_ agen.aclose()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.aclose "Link to this definition") 
    
Returns an awaitable that when run will throw a [`GeneratorExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#GeneratorExit "GeneratorExit") into the asynchronous generator function at the point where it was paused. If the asynchronous generator function then exits gracefully, is already closed, or raises [`GeneratorExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#GeneratorExit "GeneratorExit") (by not catching the exception), then the returned awaitable will raise a [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception. Any further awaitables returned by subsequent calls to the asynchronous generator will raise a [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") exception. If the asynchronous generator yields a value, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised by the awaitable. If the asynchronous generator raises any other exception, it is propagated to the caller of the awaitable. If the asynchronous generator has already exited due to an exception or normal exit, then further calls to [`aclose()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#agen.aclose "agen.aclose") will return an awaitable that does nothing.
##  6.3. Primaries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#primaries "Link to this heading")
Primaries represent the most tightly bound operations of the language. Their syntax is:
```
**primary** ::= [atom](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-atom) | [attributeref](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-attributeref) | [subscription](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-subscription) | [slicing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-slicing) | [call](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-call)

```

###  6.3.1. Attribute references[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#attribute-references "Link to this heading")
An attribute reference is a primary followed by a period and a name:
```
**attributeref** ::= [primary](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-primary) "." [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)

```

The primary must evaluate to an object of a type that supports attribute references, which most objects do. This object is then asked to produce the attribute whose name is the identifier. The type and value produced is determined by the object. Multiple evaluations of the same attribute reference may yield different objects.
This production can be customized by overriding the [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") method or the [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") method. The `__getattribute__()` method is called first and either returns a value or raises [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") if the attribute is not available.
If an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") is raised and the object has a `__getattr__()` method, that method is called as a fallback.
###  6.3.2. Subscriptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#subscriptions "Link to this heading")
[container class](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#sequence-types) will generally select an element from the container. The subscription of a [generic class](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generic-type) will generally return a [GenericAlias](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-genericalias) object.
```
**subscription** ::= [primary](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-primary) "[" [flexible_expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-flexible_expression_list) "]"

```

When an object is subscripted, the interpreter will evaluate the primary and the expression list.
The primary must evaluate to an object that supports subscription. An object may support subscription through defining one or both of [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") and [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__"). When the primary is subscripted, the evaluated result of the expression list will be passed to one of these methods. For more details on when `__class_getitem__` is called instead of `__getitem__`, see [__class_getitem__ versus __getitem__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classgetitem-versus-getitem).
If the expression list contains at least one comma, or if any of the expressions are starred, the expression list will evaluate to a [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing the items of the expression list. Otherwise, the expression list will evaluate to the value of the list’s sole member.
Changed in version 3.11: Expressions in an expression list may be starred. See [**PEP 646**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/).
For built-in objects, there are two types of objects that support subscription via [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"):
  1. Mappings. If the primary is a [mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping), the expression list must evaluate to an object whose value is one of the keys of the mapping, and the subscription selects the value in the mapping that corresponds to that key. An example of a builtin mapping class is the [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") class.
  2. Sequences. If the primary is a [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence), the expression list must evaluate to an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") or a [`slice`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice "slice") (as discussed in the following section). Examples of builtin sequence classes include the [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str"), [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") and [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") classes.


The formal syntax makes no special provision for negative indices in [sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence). However, built-in sequences all provide a [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") method that interprets negative indices by adding the length of the sequence to the index so that, for example, `x[-1]` selects the last item of `x`. The resulting value must be a nonnegative integer less than the number of items in the sequence, and the subscription selects the item whose index is that value (counting from zero). Since the support for negative indices and slicing occurs in the object’s [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") method, subclasses overriding this method will need to explicitly add that support.
A [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") is a special kind of sequence whose items are _characters_. A character is not a separate data type but a string of exactly one character.
###  6.3.3. Slicings[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#slicings "Link to this heading")
[`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) statements. The syntax for a slicing:
```
**slicing**      ::= [primary](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-primary) "[" [slice_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-slice_list) "]"
**slice_list**   ::= [slice_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-slice_item) ("," [slice_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-slice_item))* [","]
**slice_item**   ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) | [proper_slice](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-proper_slice)
**proper_slice** ::= [[lower_bound](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-lower_bound)] ":" [[upper_bound](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-upper_bound)] [ ":" [[stride](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stride)] ]
**lower_bound**  ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)
**upper_bound**  ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)
**stride**       ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)

```

There is ambiguity in the formal syntax here: anything that looks like an expression list also looks like a slice list, so any subscription can be interpreted as a slicing. Rather than further complicating the syntax, this is disambiguated by defining that in this case the interpretation as a subscription takes priority over the interpretation as a slicing (this is the case if the slice list contains no proper slice).
The semantics for a slicing are as follows. The primary is indexed (using the same [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") method as normal subscription) with a key that is constructed from the slice list, as follows. If the slice list contains at least one comma, the key is a tuple containing the conversion of the slice items; otherwise, the conversion of the lone slice item is the key. The conversion of a slice item that is an expression is that expression. The conversion of a proper slice is a slice object (see section [The standard type hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types)) whose [`start`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.start "slice.start"), [`stop`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.stop "slice.stop") and [`step`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.step "slice.step") attributes are the values of the expressions given as lower bound, upper bound and stride, respectively, substituting `None` for missing expressions.
###  6.3.4. Calls[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls "Link to this heading")
A call calls a callable object (e.g., a [function](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-function)) with a possibly empty series of [arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument):
```
**call**                 ::= [primary](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-primary) "(" [[argument_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-argument_list) [","] | [comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comprehension)] ")"
**argument_list**        ::= [positional_arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-positional_arguments) ["," [starred_and_keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_and_keywords)]
                         ["," [keywords_arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keywords_arguments)]
                         | [starred_and_keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_and_keywords) ["," [keywords_arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keywords_arguments)]
                         | [keywords_arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keywords_arguments)
**positional_arguments** ::= [positional_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-positional_item) ("," [positional_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-positional_item))*
**positional_item**      ::= [assignment_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) | "*" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)
**starred_and_keywords** ::= ("*" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) | [keyword_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_item))
                         ("," "*" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) | "," [keyword_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_item))*
**keywords_arguments**   ::= ([keyword_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_item) | "**" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression))
                         ("," [keyword_item](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-keyword_item) | "," "**" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression))*
**keyword_item**         ::= [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) "=" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)

```

An optional trailing comma may be present after the positional and keyword arguments but does not affect the semantics.
The primary must evaluate to a callable object (user-defined functions, built-in functions, methods of built-in objects, class objects, methods of class instances, and all objects having a [`__call__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__ "object.__call__") method are callable). All argument expressions are evaluated before the call is attempted. Please refer to section [Function definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function) for the syntax of formal [parameter](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter) lists.
If keyword arguments are present, they are first converted to positional arguments, as follows. First, a list of unfilled slots is created for the formal parameters. If there are N positional arguments, they are placed in the first N slots. Next, for each keyword argument, the identifier is used to determine the corresponding slot (if the identifier is the same as the first formal parameter name, the first slot is used, and so on). If the slot is already filled, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised. Otherwise, the argument is placed in the slot, filling it (even if the expression is `None`, it fills the slot). When all arguments have been processed, the slots that are still unfilled are filled with the corresponding default value from the function definition. (Default values are calculated, once, when the function is defined; thus, a mutable object such as a list or dictionary used as default value will be shared by all calls that don’t specify an argument value for the corresponding slot; this should usually be avoided.) If there are any unfilled slots for which no default value is specified, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised. Otherwise, the list of filled slots is used as the argument list for the call.
**CPython implementation detail:** An implementation may provide built-in functions whose positional parameters do not have names, even if they are ‘named’ for the purpose of documentation, and which therefore cannot be supplied by keyword. In CPython, this is the case for functions implemented in C that use [`PyArg_ParseTuple()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#c.PyArg_ParseTuple "PyArg_ParseTuple") to parse their arguments.
If there are more positional arguments than there are formal parameter slots, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised, unless a formal parameter using the syntax `*identifier` is present; in this case, that formal parameter receives a tuple containing the excess positional arguments (or an empty tuple if there were no excess positional arguments).
If any keyword argument does not correspond to a formal parameter name, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised, unless a formal parameter using the syntax `**identifier` is present; in this case, that formal parameter receives a dictionary containing the excess keyword arguments (using the keywords as keys and the argument values as corresponding values), or a (new) empty dictionary if there were no excess keyword arguments.
If the syntax `*expression` appears in the function call, `expression` must evaluate to an [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable). Elements from these iterables are treated as if they were additional positional arguments. For the call `f(x1, x2, *y, x3, x4)`, if _y_ evaluates to a sequence _y1_ , …, _yM_ , this is equivalent to a call with M+4 positional arguments _x1_ , _x2_ , _y1_ , …, _yM_ , _x3_ , _x4_.
A consequence of this is that although the `*expression` syntax may appear _after_ explicit keyword arguments, it is processed _before_ the keyword arguments (and any `**expression` arguments – see below). So:
Copy```
>>> deff(a, b):
...     print(a, b)
...
>>> f(b=1, *(2,))
2 1
>>> f(a=1, *(2,))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: f() got multiple values for keyword argument 'a'
>>> f(1, *(2,))
1 2

```

It is unusual for both keyword arguments and the `*expression` syntax to be used in the same call, so in practice this confusion does not often arise.
If the syntax `**expression` appears in the function call, `expression` must evaluate to a [mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping), the contents of which are treated as additional keyword arguments. If a parameter matching a key has already been given a value (by an explicit keyword argument, or from another unpacking), a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised.
When `**expression` is used, each key in this mapping must be a string. Each value from the mapping is assigned to the first formal parameter eligible for keyword assignment whose name is equal to the key. A key need not be a Python identifier (e.g. `"max-temp °F"` is acceptable, although it will not match any formal parameter that could be declared). If there is no match to a formal parameter the key-value pair is collected by the `**` parameter, if there is one, or if there is not, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised.
Formal parameters using the syntax `*identifier` or `**identifier` cannot be used as positional argument slots or as keyword argument names.
Changed in version 3.5: Function calls accept any number of `*` and `**` unpackings, positional arguments may follow iterable unpackings (`*`), and keyword arguments may follow dictionary unpackings (`**`). Originally proposed by [**PEP 448**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0448/).
A call always returns some value, possibly `None`, unless it raises an exception. How this value is computed depends on the type of the callable object.
If it is— 

a user-defined function:
    
The code block for the function is executed, passing it the argument list. The first thing the code block will do is bind the formal parameters to the arguments; this is described in section [Function definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function). When the code block executes a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement, this specifies the return value of the function call. If execution reaches the end of the code block without executing a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement, the return value is `None`. 

a built-in function or method:
    
The result is up to the interpreter; see [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-funcs) for the descriptions of built-in functions and methods. 

a class object:
    
A new instance of that class is returned. 

a class instance method:
    
The corresponding user-defined function is called, with an argument list that is one longer than the argument list of the call: the instance becomes the first argument. 

a class instance:
    
The class must define a [`__call__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__ "object.__call__") method; the effect is then the same as if that method was called.
##  6.4. Await expression[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await-expression "Link to this heading")
Suspend the execution of [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine) on an [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) object. Can only be used inside a [coroutine function](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine-function).
```
**await_expr** ::= "await" [primary](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-primary)

```

Added in version 3.5.
##  6.5. The power operator[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operator "Link to this heading")
The power operator binds more tightly than unary operators on its left; it binds less tightly than unary operators on its right. The syntax is:
```
**power** ::= ([await_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-await_expr) | [primary](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-primary)) ["**" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr)]

```

Thus, in an unparenthesized sequence of power and unary operators, the operators are evaluated from right to left (this does not constrain the evaluation order for the operands): `-1**2` results in `-1`.
The power operator has the same semantics as the built-in [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow "pow") function, when called with two arguments: it yields its left argument raised to the power of its right argument. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type, and the result is of that type.
For int operands, the result has the same type as the operands unless the second argument is negative; in that case, all arguments are converted to float and a float result is delivered. For example, `10**2` returns `100`, but `10**-2` returns `0.01`.
Raising `0.0` to a negative power results in a [`ZeroDivisionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "ZeroDivisionError"). Raising a negative number to a fractional power results in a [`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex "complex") number. (In earlier versions it raised a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").)
This operation can be customized using the special [`__pow__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pow__ "object.__pow__") and [`__rpow__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rpow__ "object.__rpow__") methods.
##  6.6. Unary arithmetic and bitwise operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#unary-arithmetic-and-bitwise-operations "Link to this heading")
All unary arithmetic and bitwise operations have the same priority:
```
**u_expr** ::= [power](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-power) | "-" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr) | "+" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr) | "~" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr)

```

The unary `-` (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric argument; the operation can be overridden with the [`__neg__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__neg__ "object.__neg__") special method.
The unary `+` (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged; the operation can be overridden with the [`__pos__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pos__ "object.__pos__") special method.
The unary `~` (invert) operator yields the bitwise inversion of its integer argument. The bitwise inversion of `x` is defined as `-(x+1)`. It only applies to integral numbers or to custom objects that override the [`__invert__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__invert__ "object.__invert__") special method.
In all three cases, if the argument does not have the proper type, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception is raised.
##  6.7. Binary arithmetic operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations "Link to this heading")
The binary arithmetic operations have the conventional priority levels. Note that some of these operations also apply to certain non-numeric types. Apart from the power operator, there are only two levels, one for multiplicative operators and one for additive operators:
```
**m_expr** ::= [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr) | [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) "*" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr) | [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) "@" [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) |
           [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) "//" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr) | [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) "/" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr) |
           [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) "%" [u_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-u_expr)
**a_expr** ::= [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) | [a_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-a_expr) "+" [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr) | [a_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-a_expr) "-" [m_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-m_expr)

```

The `*` (multiplication) operator yields the product of its arguments. The arguments must either both be numbers, or one argument must be an integer and the other must be a sequence. In the former case, the numbers are converted to a common type and then multiplied together. In the latter case, sequence repetition is performed; a negative repetition factor yields an empty sequence.
This operation can be customized using the special [`__mul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mul__ "object.__mul__") and [`__rmul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmul__ "object.__rmul__") methods.
The `@` (at) operator is intended to be used for matrix multiplication. No builtin Python types implement this operator.
This operation can be customized using the special [`__matmul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__matmul__ "object.__matmul__") and [`__rmatmul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmatmul__ "object.__rmatmul__") methods.
Added in version 3.5.
The `/` (division) and `//` (floor division) operators yield the quotient of their arguments. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type. Division of integers yields a float, while floor division of integers results in an integer; the result is that of mathematical division with the ‘floor’ function applied to the result. Division by zero raises the [`ZeroDivisionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "ZeroDivisionError") exception.
The division operation can be customized using the special [`__truediv__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__truediv__ "object.__truediv__") and [`__rtruediv__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rtruediv__ "object.__rtruediv__") methods. The floor division operation can be customized using the special [`__floordiv__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__floordiv__ "object.__floordiv__") and [`__rfloordiv__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rfloordiv__ "object.__rfloordiv__") methods.
The `%` (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type. A zero right argument raises the [`ZeroDivisionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "ZeroDivisionError") exception. The arguments may be floating-point numbers, e.g., `3.14%0.7` equals `0.34` (since `3.14` equals `4*0.7 + 0.34`.) The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id19).
The floor division and modulo operators are connected by the following identity: `x == (x//y)*y + (x%y)`. Floor division and modulo are also connected with the built-in function [`divmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod "divmod"): `divmod(x, y) == (x//y, x%y)`. [[2]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id20).
In addition to performing the modulo operation on numbers, the `%` operator is also overloaded by string objects to perform old-style string formatting (also known as interpolation). The syntax for string formatting is described in the Python Library Reference, section [printf-style String Formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting).
The _modulo_ operation can be customized using the special [`__mod__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mod__ "object.__mod__") and [`__rmod__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmod__ "object.__rmod__") methods.
The floor division operator, the modulo operator, and the [`divmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod "divmod") function are not defined for complex numbers. Instead, convert to a floating-point number using the [`abs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs "abs") function if appropriate.
The `+` (addition) operator yields the sum of its arguments. The arguments must either both be numbers or both be sequences of the same type. In the former case, the numbers are converted to a common type and then added together. In the latter case, the sequences are concatenated.
This operation can be customized using the special [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__") and [`__radd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "object.__radd__") methods.
The `-` (subtraction) operator yields the difference of its arguments. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type.
This operation can be customized using the special [`__sub__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__sub__ "object.__sub__") and [`__rsub__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rsub__ "object.__rsub__") methods.
##  6.8. Shifting operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#shifting-operations "Link to this heading")
The shifting operations have lower priority than the arithmetic operations:
```
**shift_expr** ::= [a_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-a_expr) | [shift_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shift_expr) ("<<" | ">>") [a_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-a_expr)

```

These operators accept integers as arguments. They shift the first argument to the left or right by the number of bits given by the second argument.
The left shift operation can be customized using the special [`__lshift__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lshift__ "object.__lshift__") and [`__rlshift__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rlshift__ "object.__rlshift__") methods. The right shift operation can be customized using the special [`__rshift__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rshift__ "object.__rshift__") and [`__rrshift__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rrshift__ "object.__rrshift__") methods.
A right shift by _n_ bits is defined as floor division by `pow(2,n)`. A left shift by _n_ bits is defined as multiplication with `pow(2,n)`.
##  6.9. Binary bitwise operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operations "Link to this heading")
Each of the three bitwise operations has a different priority level:
```
**and_expr** ::= [shift_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shift_expr) | [and_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-and_expr) "&" [shift_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-shift_expr)
**xor_expr** ::= [and_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-and_expr) | [xor_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-xor_expr) "^" [and_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-and_expr)
**or_expr**  ::= [xor_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-xor_expr) | [or_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_expr) "|" [xor_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-xor_expr)

```

The `&` operator yields the bitwise AND of its arguments, which must be integers or one of them must be a custom object overriding [`__and__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__and__ "object.__and__") or [`__rand__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rand__ "object.__rand__") special methods.
The `^` operator yields the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of its arguments, which must be integers or one of them must be a custom object overriding [`__xor__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__xor__ "object.__xor__") or [`__rxor__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rxor__ "object.__rxor__") special methods.
The `|` operator yields the bitwise (inclusive) OR of its arguments, which must be integers or one of them must be a custom object overriding [`__or__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__or__ "object.__or__") or [`__ror__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ror__ "object.__ror__") special methods.
##  6.10. Comparisons[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons "Link to this heading")
Unlike C, all comparison operations in Python have the same priority, which is lower than that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise operation. Also unlike C, expressions like `a < b < c` have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:
```
**comparison**    ::= [or_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_expr) ([comp_operator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comp_operator) [or_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_expr))*
**comp_operator** ::= "<" | ">" | "==" | ">=" | "<=" | "!="
                  | "is" ["not"] | ["not"] "in"

```

Comparisons yield boolean values: `True` or `False`. Custom _rich comparison methods_ may return non-boolean values. In this case Python will call [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "bool") on such value in boolean contexts.
Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., `x < y <= z` is equivalent to `x < y and y <= z`, except that `y` is evaluated only once (but in both cases `z` is not evaluated at all when `x < y` is found to be false).
Formally, if _a_ , _b_ , _c_ , …, _y_ , _z_ are expressions and _op1_ , _op2_ , …, _opN_ are comparison operators, then `a op1 b op2 c ... y opN z` is equivalent to `a op1 b and b op2 c and ... y opN z`, except that each expression is evaluated at most once.
Note that `a op1 b op2 c` doesn’t imply any kind of comparison between _a_ and _c_ , so that, e.g., `x < y > z` is perfectly legal (though perhaps not pretty).
###  6.10.1. Value comparisons[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#value-comparisons "Link to this heading")
The operators `<`, `>`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`, and `!=` compare the values of two objects. The objects do not need to have the same type.
Chapter [Objects, values and types](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects) states that objects have a value (in addition to type and identity). The value of an object is a rather abstract notion in Python: For example, there is no canonical access method for an object’s value. Also, there is no requirement that the value of an object should be constructed in a particular way, e.g. comprised of all its data attributes. Comparison operators implement a particular notion of what the value of an object is. One can think of them as defining the value of an object indirectly, by means of their comparison implementation.
Because all types are (direct or indirect) subtypes of [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"), they inherit the default comparison behavior from [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"). Types can customize their comparison behavior by implementing _rich comparison methods_ like [`__lt__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__ "object.__lt__"), described in [Basic customization](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customization).
The default behavior for equality comparison (`==` and `!=`) is based on the identity of the objects. Hence, equality comparison of instances with the same identity results in equality, and equality comparison of instances with different identities results in inequality. A motivation for this default behavior is the desire that all objects should be reflexive (i.e. `x is y` implies `x == y`).
A default order comparison (`<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`) is not provided; an attempt raises [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). A motivation for this default behavior is the lack of a similar invariant as for equality.
The behavior of the default equality comparison, that instances with different identities are always unequal, may be in contrast to what types will need that have a sensible definition of object value and value-based equality. Such types will need to customize their comparison behavior, and in fact, a number of built-in types have done that.
The following list describes the comparison behavior of the most important built-in types.
  * Numbers of built-in numeric types ([Numeric Types — int, float, complex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric)) and of the standard library types [`fractions.Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction "fractions.Fraction") and [`decimal.Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") can be compared within and across their types, with the restriction that complex numbers do not support order comparison. Within the limits of the types involved, they compare mathematically (algorithmically) correct without loss of precision.
The not-a-number values `float('NaN')` and `decimal.Decimal('NaN')` are special. Any ordered comparison of a number to a not-a-number value is false. A counter-intuitive implication is that not-a-number values are not equal to themselves. For example, if `x = float('NaN')`, `3 < x`, `x < 3` and `x == x` are all false, while `x != x` is true. This behavior is compliant with IEEE 754.
  * `None` and [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") are singletons. [**PEP 8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) advises that comparisons for singletons should always be done with `is` or `is not`, never the equality operators.
  * Binary sequences (instances of [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") or [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray")) can be compared within and across their types. They compare lexicographically using the numeric values of their elements.
  * Strings (instances of [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str")) compare lexicographically using the numerical Unicode code points (the result of the built-in function [`ord()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord "ord")) of their characters. [[3]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id21)
Strings and binary sequences cannot be directly compared.
  * Sequences (instances of [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple"), [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list"), or [`range`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range")) can be compared only within each of their types, with the restriction that ranges do not support order comparison. Equality comparison across these types results in inequality, and ordering comparison across these types raises [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
Sequences compare lexicographically using comparison of corresponding elements. The built-in containers typically assume identical objects are equal to themselves. That lets them bypass equality tests for identical objects to improve performance and to maintain their internal invariants.
Lexicographical comparison between built-in collections works as follows:
    * For two collections to compare equal, they must be of the same type, have the same length, and each pair of corresponding elements must compare equal (for example, `[1,2] == (1,2)` is false because the type is not the same).
    * Collections that support order comparison are ordered the same as their first unequal elements (for example, `[1,2,x] <= [1,2,y]` has the same value as `x <= y`). If a corresponding element does not exist, the shorter collection is ordered first (for example, `[1,2] < [1,2,3]` is true).
  * Mappings (instances of [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict")) compare equal if and only if they have equal `(key, value)` pairs. Equality comparison of the keys and values enforces reflexivity.
Order comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`) raise [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
  * Sets (instances of [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") or [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset")) can be compared within and across their types.
They define order comparison operators to mean subset and superset tests. Those relations do not define total orderings (for example, the two sets `{1,2}` and `{2,3}` are not equal, nor subsets of one another, nor supersets of one another). Accordingly, sets are not appropriate arguments for functions which depend on total ordering (for example, [`min()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min "min"), [`max()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max "max"), and [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted "sorted") produce undefined results given a list of sets as inputs).
Comparison of sets enforces reflexivity of its elements.
  * Most other built-in types have no comparison methods implemented, so they inherit the default comparison behavior.


User-defined classes that customize their comparison behavior should follow some consistency rules, if possible:
  * Equality comparison should be reflexive. In other words, identical objects should compare equal:
> `x is y` implies `x == y`
  * Comparison should be symmetric. In other words, the following expressions should have the same result:
> `x == y` and `y == x`
> `x != y` and `y != x`
> `x < y` and `y > x`
> `x <= y` and `y >= x`
  * Comparison should be transitive. The following (non-exhaustive) examples illustrate that:
> `x > y and y > z` implies `x > z`
> `x < y and y <= z` implies `x < z`
  * Inverse comparison should result in the boolean negation. In other words, the following expressions should have the same result:
> `x == y` and `not x != y`
> `x < y` and `not x >= y` (for total ordering)
> `x > y` and `not x <= y` (for total ordering)
The last two expressions apply to totally ordered collections (e.g. to sequences, but not to sets or mappings). See also the [`total_ordering()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering "functools.total_ordering") decorator.
  * The [`hash()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash "hash") result should be consistent with equality. Objects that are equal should either have the same hash value, or be marked as unhashable.


Python does not enforce these consistency rules. In fact, the not-a-number values are an example for not following these rules.
###  6.10.2. Membership test operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-operations "Link to this heading")
The operators [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) and [`not in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not-in) test for membership. `x in s` evaluates to `True` if _x_ is a member of _s_ , and `False` otherwise. `x not in s` returns the negation of `x in s`. All built-in sequences and set types support this as well as dictionary, for which `in` tests whether the dictionary has a given key. For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression `x in y` is equivalent to `any(x is e or x == e for e in y)`.
For the string and bytes types, `x in y` is `True` if and only if _x_ is a substring of _y_. An equivalent test is `y.find(x) != -1`. Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other string, so `"" in "abc"` will return `True`.
For user-defined classes which define the [`__contains__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__ "object.__contains__") method, `x in y` returns `True` if `y.__contains__(x)` returns a true value, and `False` otherwise.
For user-defined classes which do not define [`__contains__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__ "object.__contains__") but do define [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__ "object.__iter__"), `x in y` is `True` if some value `z`, for which the expression `x is z or x == z` is true, is produced while iterating over `y`. If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) raised that exception.
Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"), `x in y` is `True` if and only if there is a non-negative integer index _i_ such that `x is y[i] or x == y[i]`, and no lower integer index raises the [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError") exception. (If any other exception is raised, it is as if [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) raised that exception).
The operator [`not in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not-in) is defined to have the inverse truth value of [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in).
###  6.10.3. Identity comparisons[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is-not "Link to this heading")
The operators [`is`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is) and [`is not`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is-not) test for an object’s identity: `x is y` is true if and only if _x_ and _y_ are the same object. An Object’s identity is determined using the [`id()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id "id") function. `x is not y` yields the inverse truth value. [[4]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id22)
##  6.11. Boolean operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations "Link to this heading")
```
**or_test**  ::= [and_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-and_test) | [or_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_test) "or" [and_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-and_test)
**and_test** ::= [not_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-not_test) | [and_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-and_test) "and" [not_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-not_test)
**not_test** ::= [comparison](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-comparison) | "not" [not_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-not_test)

```

In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false: `False`, `None`, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true. User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a [`__bool__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__ "object.__bool__") method.
The operator [`not`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not) yields `True` if its argument is false, `False` otherwise.
The expression `x and y` first evaluates _x_ ; if _x_ is false, its value is returned; otherwise, _y_ is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.
The expression `x or y` first evaluates _x_ ; if _x_ is true, its value is returned; otherwise, _y_ is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.
Note that neither [`and`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#and) nor [`or`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#or) restrict the value and type they return to `False` and `True`, but rather return the last evaluated argument. This is sometimes useful, e.g., if `s` is a string that should be replaced by a default value if it is empty, the expression `s or 'foo'` yields the desired value. Because [`not`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not) has to create a new value, it returns a boolean value regardless of the type of its argument (for example, `not 'foo'` produces `False` rather than `''`.)
##  6.12. Assignment expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#assignment-expressions "Link to this heading")
```
**assignment_expression** ::= [[identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) ":="] [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)

```

An assignment expression (sometimes also called a “named expression” or “walrus”) assigns an [`expression`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) to an [`identifier`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier), while also returning the value of the [`expression`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression).
One common use case is when handling matched regular expressions:
Copy```
if matching := pattern.search(data):
    do_something(matching)

```

Or, when processing a file stream in chunks:
Copy```
while chunk := file.read(9000):
    process(chunk)

```

Assignment expressions must be surrounded by parentheses when used as expression statements and when used as sub-expressions in slicing, conditional, lambda, keyword-argument, and comprehension-if expressions and in `assert`, `with`, and `assignment` statements. In all other places where they can be used, parentheses are not required, including in `if` and `while` statements.
Added in version 3.8: See [**PEP 572**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/) for more details about assignment expressions.
##  6.13. Conditional expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions "Link to this heading")
```
**conditional_expression** ::= [or_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_test) ["if" [or_test](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_test) "else" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)]
**expression**             ::= [conditional_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-conditional_expression) | [lambda_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-lambda_expr)

```

Conditional expressions (sometimes called a “ternary operator”) have the lowest priority of all Python operations.
The expression `x if C else y` first evaluates the condition, _C_ rather than _x_. If _C_ is true, _x_ is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, _y_ is evaluated and its value is returned.
See [**PEP 308**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0308/) for more details about conditional expressions.
##  6.14. Lambdas[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda "Link to this heading")
```
**lambda_expr** ::= "lambda" [[parameter_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-parameter_list)] ":" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)

```

Lambda expressions (sometimes called lambda forms) are used to create anonymous functions. The expression `lambda parameters: expression` yields a function object. The unnamed object behaves like a function object defined with:
See section [Function definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function) for the syntax of parameter lists. Note that functions created with lambda expressions cannot contain statements or annotations.
##  6.15. Expression lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expression-lists "Link to this heading")
```
**starred_expression**       ::= ["*"] [or_expr](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-or_expr)
**flexible_expression**      ::= [assignment_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assignment_expression) | [starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression)
**flexible_expression_list** ::= [flexible_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-flexible_expression) ("," [flexible_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-flexible_expression))* [","]
**starred_expression_list**  ::= [starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression) ("," [starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression))* [","]
**expression_list**          ::= [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ("," [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression))* [","]
**yield_list**               ::= [expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression_list) | [starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression) "," [[starred_expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression_list)]

```

Except when part of a list or set display, an expression list containing at least one comma yields a tuple. The length of the tuple is the number of expressions in the list. The expressions are evaluated from left to right.
An asterisk `*` denotes _iterable unpacking_. Its operand must be an [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable). The iterable is expanded into a sequence of items, which are included in the new tuple, list, or set, at the site of the unpacking.
Added in version 3.5: Iterable unpacking in expression lists, originally proposed by [**PEP 448**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0448/).
Added in version 3.11: Any item in an expression list may be starred. See [**PEP 646**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/).
A trailing comma is required only to create a one-item tuple, such as `1,`; it is optional in all other cases. A single expression without a trailing comma doesn’t create a tuple, but rather yields the value of that expression. (To create an empty tuple, use an empty pair of parentheses: `()`.)
##  6.16. Evaluation order[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order "Link to this heading")
Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side.
In the following lines, expressions will be evaluated in the arithmetic order of their suffixes:
Copy```
expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4
(expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4)
{expr1: expr2, expr3: expr4}
expr1 + expr2 * (expr3 - expr4)
expr1(expr2, expr3, *expr4, **expr5)
expr3, expr4 = expr1, expr2

```

##  6.17. Operator precedence[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence "Link to this heading")
The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python, from highest precedence (most binding) to lowest precedence (least binding). Operators in the same box have the same precedence. Unless the syntax is explicitly given, operators are binary. Operators in the same box group left to right (except for exponentiation and conditional expressions, which group from right to left).
Note that comparisons, membership tests, and identity tests, all have the same precedence and have a left-to-right chaining feature as described in the [Comparisons](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) section.

Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id10)]
While `abs(x%y) < abs(y)` is true mathematically, for floats it may not be true numerically due to roundoff. For example, and assuming a platform on which a Python float is an IEEE 754 double-precision number, in order that `-1e-100 % 1e100` have the same sign as `1e100`, the computed result is `-1e-100 + 1e100`, which is numerically exactly equal to `1e100`. The function [`math.fmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.fmod "math.fmod") returns a result whose sign matches the sign of the first argument instead, and so returns `-1e-100` in this case. Which approach is more appropriate depends on the application.
[[2](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id11)]
If x is very close to an exact integer multiple of y, it’s possible for `x//y` to be one larger than `(x-x%y)//y` due to rounding. In such cases, Python returns the latter result, in order to preserve that `divmod(x,y)[0] * y + x % y` be very close to `x`.
[[3](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id13)]
The Unicode standard distinguishes between _code points_ (e.g. U+0041) and _abstract characters_ (e.g. “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A”). While most abstract characters in Unicode are only represented using one code point, there is a number of abstract characters that can in addition be represented using a sequence of more than one code point. For example, the abstract character “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA” can be represented as a single _precomposed character_ at code position U+00C7, or as a sequence of a _base character_ at code position U+0043 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C), followed by a _combining character_ at code position U+0327 (COMBINING CEDILLA).
The comparison operators on strings compare at the level of Unicode code points. This may be counter-intuitive to humans. For example, `"\u00C7" == "\u0043\u0327"` is `False`, even though both strings represent the same abstract character “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA”.
To compare strings at the level of abstract characters (that is, in a way intuitive to humans), use [`unicodedata.normalize()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize "unicodedata.normalize").
[[4](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id14)]
Due to automatic garbage-collection, free lists, and the dynamic nature of descriptors, you may notice seemingly unusual behaviour in certain uses of the [`is`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is) operator, like those involving comparisons between instance methods, or constants. Check their documentation for more info.
[[5](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id17)]
The power operator `**` binds less tightly than an arithmetic or bitwise unary operator on its right, that is, `2**-1` is `0.5`.
[[6](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#id18)]
The `%` operator is also used for string formatting; the same precedence applies.

#  10. Full Grammar specification[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html#full-grammar-specification "Link to this heading")
This is the full Python grammar, derived directly from the grammar used to generate the CPython parser (see [Grammar/python.gram](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Grammar/python.gram)). The version here omits details related to code generation and error recovery.
The notation is a mixture of [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) and [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar). In particular, `&` followed by a symbol, token or parenthesized group indicates a positive lookahead (i.e., is required to match but not consumed), while `!` indicates a negative lookahead (i.e., is required _not_ to match). We use the `|` separator to mean PEG’s “ordered choice” (written as `/` in traditional PEG grammars). See [**PEP 617**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0617/) for more details on the grammar’s syntax.
```
# PEG grammar for Python



# ========================= START OF THE GRAMMAR =========================

# General grammatical elements and rules:
#
# * Strings with double quotes (") denote SOFT KEYWORDS
# * Strings with single quotes (') denote KEYWORDS
# * Upper case names (NAME) denote tokens in the Grammar/Tokens file
# * Rule names starting with "invalid_" are used for specialized syntax errors
#     - These rules are NOT used in the first pass of the parser.
#     - Only if the first pass fails to parse, a second pass including the invalid
#       rules will be executed.
#     - If the parser fails in the second phase with a generic syntax error, the
#       location of the generic failure of the first pass will be used (this avoids
#       reporting incorrect locations due to the invalid rules).
#     - The order of the alternatives involving invalid rules matter
#       (like any rule in PEG).
#
# Grammar Syntax (see PEP 617 for more information):
#
# rule_name: expression
#   Optionally, a type can be included right after the rule name, which
#   specifies the return type of the C or Python function corresponding to the
#   rule:
# rule_name[return_type]: expression
#   If the return type is omitted, then a void * is returned in C and an Any in
#   Python.
# e1 e2
#   Match e1, then match e2.
# e1 | e2
#   Match e1 or e2.
#   The first alternative can also appear on the line after the rule name for
#   formatting purposes. In that case, a | must be used before the first
#   alternative, like so:
#       rule_name[return_type]:
#            | first_alt
#            | second_alt
# ( e )
#   Match e (allows also to use other operators in the group like '(e)*')
# [ e ] or e?
#   Optionally match e.
# e*
#   Match zero or more occurrences of e.
# e+
#   Match one or more occurrences of e.
# s.e+
#   Match one or more occurrences of e, separated by s. The generated parse tree
#   does not include the separator. This is otherwise identical to (e (s e)*).
# &e
#   Succeed if e can be parsed, without consuming any input.
# !e
#   Fail if e can be parsed, without consuming any input.
# ~
#   Commit to the current alternative, even if it fails to parse.
# &&e
#   Eager parse e. The parser will not backtrack and will immediately
#   fail with SyntaxError if e cannot be parsed.

#  5. The import system[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-import-system "Link to this heading")
Python code in one [module](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module) gains access to the code in another module by the process of [importing](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-importing) it. The [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way. Functions such as [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module "importlib.import_module") and built-in [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") can also be used to invoke the import machinery.
The [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the `import` statement is defined as a call to the [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") is used to perform the name binding operation of the `import` statement. See the `import` statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.
A direct call to [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") performs only the module search and, if found, the module creation operation. While certain side-effects may occur, such as the importing of parent packages, and the updating of various caches (including [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules")), only the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement performs a name binding operation.
When an [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement is executed, the standard builtin [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") function is called. Other mechanisms for invoking the import system (such as [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module "importlib.import_module")) may choose to bypass [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") and use their own solutions to implement import semantics.
When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if found, it creates a module object [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#fnmo), initializing it. If the named module cannot be found, a [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") is raised. Python implements various strategies to search for the named module when the import machinery is invoked. These strategies can be modified and extended by using various hooks described in the sections below.
Changed in version 3.3: The import system has been updated to fully implement the second phase of [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/). There is no longer any implicit import machinery - the full import system is exposed through [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path"). In addition, native namespace package support has been implemented (see [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/)).
##  5.1. [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery.")[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#importlib "Link to this heading")
The [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery.") module provides a rich API for interacting with the import system. For example [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module "importlib.import_module") provides a recommended, simpler API than built-in [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") for invoking the import machinery. Refer to the [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery.") library documentation for additional detail.
##  5.2. Packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages "Link to this heading")
Python has only one type of module object, and all modules are of this type, regardless of whether the module is implemented in Python, C, or something else. To help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy, Python has a concept of [packages](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package).
You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories, but don’t take this analogy too literally since packages and modules need not originate from the file system. For the purposes of this documentation, we’ll use this convenient analogy of directories and files. Like file system directories, packages are organized hierarchically, and packages may themselves contain subpackages, as well as regular modules.
It’s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packages. Or put another way, packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a `__path__` attribute is considered a package.
All modules have a name. Subpackage names are separated from their parent package name by a dot, akin to Python’s standard attribute access syntax. Thus you might have a package called [`email`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages."), which in turn has a subpackage called [`email.mime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.mime.html#module-email.mime "email.mime: Build MIME messages.") and a module within that subpackage called [`email.mime.text`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.mime.html#module-email.mime.text "email.mime.text").
###  5.2.1. Regular packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages "Link to this heading")
Python defines two types of packages, [regular packages](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-regular-package) and [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace-package). Regular packages are traditional packages as they existed in Python 3.2 and earlier. A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an `__init__.py` file. When a regular package is imported, this `__init__.py` file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are bound to names in the package’s namespace. The `__init__.py` file can contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
For example, the following file system layout defines a top level `parent` package with three subpackages:
Copy```
parent/
    __init__.py
    one/
        __init__.py
    two/
        __init__.py
    three/
        __init__.py

```

Importing `parent.one` will implicitly execute `parent/__init__.py` and `parent/one/__init__.py`. Subsequent imports of `parent.two` or `parent.three` will execute `parent/two/__init__.py` and `parent/three/__init__.py` respectively.
###  5.2.2. Namespace packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#namespace-packages "Link to this heading")
A namespace package is a composite of various [portions](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-portion), where each portion contributes a subpackage to the parent package. Portions may reside in different locations on the file system. Portions may also be found in zip files, on the network, or anywhere else that Python searches during import. Namespace packages may or may not correspond directly to objects on the file system; they may be virtual modules that have no concrete representation.
Namespace packages do not use an ordinary list for their `__path__` attribute. They instead use a custom iterable type which will automatically perform a new search for package portions on the next import attempt within that package if the path of their parent package (or [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") for a top level package) changes.
With namespace packages, there is no `parent/__init__.py` file. In fact, there may be multiple `parent` directories found during import search, where each one is provided by a different portion. Thus `parent/one` may not be physically located next to `parent/two`. In this case, Python will create a namespace package for the top-level `parent` package whenever it or one of its subpackages is imported.
See also [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) for the namespace package specification.
##  5.3. Searching[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#searching "Link to this heading")
To begin the search, Python needs the [fully qualified](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-qualified-name) name of the module (or package, but for the purposes of this discussion, the difference is immaterial) being imported. This name may come from various arguments to the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement, or from the parameters to the [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module "importlib.import_module") or [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") functions.
This name will be used in various phases of the import search, and it may be the dotted path to a submodule, e.g. `foo.bar.baz`. In this case, Python first tries to import `foo`, then `foo.bar`, and finally `foo.bar.baz`. If any of the intermediate imports fail, a [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") is raised.
###  5.3.1. The module cache[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-module-cache "Link to this heading")
The first place checked during import search is [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"). This mapping serves as a cache of all modules that have been previously imported, including the intermediate paths. So if `foo.bar.baz` was previously imported, [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") will contain entries for `foo`, `foo.bar`, and `foo.bar.baz`. Each key will have as its value the corresponding module object.
During import, the module name is looked up in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") and if present, the associated value is the module satisfying the import, and the process completes. However, if the value is `None`, then a [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") is raised. If the module name is missing, Python will continue searching for the module.
[`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") is writable. Deleting a key may not destroy the associated module (as other modules may hold references to it), but it will invalidate the cache entry for the named module, causing Python to search anew for the named module upon its next import. The key can also be assigned to `None`, forcing the next import of the module to result in a [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError").
Beware though, as if you keep a reference to the module object, invalidate its cache entry in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), and then re-import the named module, the two module objects will _not_ be the same. By contrast, [`importlib.reload()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload "importlib.reload") will reuse the _same_ module object, and simply reinitialise the module contents by rerunning the module’s code.
###  5.3.2. Finders and loaders[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#finders-and-loaders "Link to this heading")
If the named module is not found in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), then Python’s import protocol is invoked to find and load the module. This protocol consists of two conceptual objects, [finders](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-finder) and [loaders](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader). A finder’s job is to determine whether it can find the named module using whatever strategy it knows about. Objects that implement both of these interfaces are referred to as [importers](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-importer) - they return themselves when they find that they can load the requested module.
Python includes a number of default finders and importers. The first one knows how to locate built-in modules, and the second knows how to locate frozen modules. A third default finder searches an [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path) for modules. The [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path) is a list of locations that may name file system paths or zip files. It can also be extended to search for any locatable resource, such as those identified by URLs.
The import machinery is extensible, so new finders can be added to extend the range and scope of module searching.
Finders do not actually load modules. If they can find the named module, they return a _module spec_ , an encapsulation of the module’s import-related information, which the import machinery then uses when loading the module.
The following sections describe the protocol for finders and loaders in more detail, including how you can create and register new ones to extend the import machinery.
Changed in version 3.4: In previous versions of Python, finders returned [loaders](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader) directly, whereas now they return module specs which _contain_ loaders. Loaders are still used during import but have fewer responsibilities.
###  5.3.3. Import hooks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks "Link to this heading")
The import machinery is designed to be extensible; the primary mechanism for this are the _import hooks_. There are two types of import hooks: _meta hooks_ and _import path hooks_.
Meta hooks are called at the start of import processing, before any other import processing has occurred, other than [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") cache look up. This allows meta hooks to override [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") processing, frozen modules, or even built-in modules. Meta hooks are registered by adding new finder objects to [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path"), as described below.
Import path hooks are called as part of [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") (or `package.__path__`) processing, at the point where their associated path item is encountered. Import path hooks are registered by adding new callables to [`sys.path_hooks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_hooks "sys.path_hooks") as described below.
###  5.3.4. The meta path[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-meta-path "Link to this heading")
When the named module is not found in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), Python next searches [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path"), which contains a list of meta path finder objects. These finders are queried in order to see if they know how to handle the named module. Meta path finders must implement a method called [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") which takes three arguments: a name, an import path, and (optionally) a target module. The meta path finder can use any strategy it wants to determine whether it can handle the named module or not.
If the meta path finder knows how to handle the named module, it returns a spec object. If it cannot handle the named module, it returns `None`. If [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path") processing reaches the end of its list without returning a spec, then a [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") is raised. Any other exceptions raised are simply propagated up, aborting the import process.
The [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") method of meta path finders is called with two or three arguments. The first is the fully qualified name of the module being imported, for example `foo.bar.baz`. The second argument is the path entries to use for the module search. For top-level modules, the second argument is `None`, but for submodules or subpackages, the second argument is the value of the parent package’s `__path__` attribute. If the appropriate `__path__` attribute cannot be accessed, a [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") is raised. The third argument is an existing module object that will be the target of loading later. The import system passes in a target module only during reload.
The meta path may be traversed multiple times for a single import request. For example, assuming none of the modules involved has already been cached, importing `foo.bar.baz` will first perform a top level import, calling `mpf.find_spec("foo", None, None)` on each meta path finder (`mpf`). After `foo` has been imported, `foo.bar` will be imported by traversing the meta path a second time, calling `mpf.find_spec("foo.bar", foo.__path__, None)`. Once `foo.bar` has been imported, the final traversal will call `mpf.find_spec("foo.bar.baz", foo.bar.__path__, None)`.
Some meta path finders only support top level imports. These importers will always return `None` when anything other than `None` is passed as the second argument.
Python’s default [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path") has three meta path finders, one that knows how to import built-in modules, one that knows how to import frozen modules, and one that knows how to import modules from an [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path) (i.e. the [path based finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder)).
Changed in version 3.4: The [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") method of meta path finders replaced `find_module()`, which is now deprecated. While it will continue to work without change, the import machinery will try it only if the finder does not implement [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec").
Changed in version 3.10: Use of `find_module()` by the import system now raises [`ImportWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning").
Changed in version 3.12: `find_module()` has been removed. Use [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") instead.
##  5.4. Loading[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#loading "Link to this heading")
If and when a module spec is found, the import machinery will use it (and the loader it contains) when loading the module. Here is an approximation of what happens during the loading portion of import:
Copy```
module = None
if spec.loader is not None and hasattr(spec.loader, 'create_module'):
    # It is assumed 'exec_module' will also be defined on the loader.
    module = spec.loader.create_module(spec)
if module is None:
    module = ModuleType(spec.name)
# The import-related module attributes get set here:
_init_module_attrs(spec, module)

if spec.loader is None:
    # unsupported
    raise ImportError
if spec.origin is None and spec.submodule_search_locations is not None:
    # namespace package
    sys.modules[spec.name] = module
elif not hasattr(spec.loader, 'exec_module'):
    module = spec.loader.load_module(spec.name)
else:
    sys.modules[spec.name] = module
    try:
        spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    except BaseException:
        try:
            del sys.modules[spec.name]
        except KeyError:
            pass
        raise
return sys.modules[spec.name]

```

Note the following details:
  * If there is an existing module object with the given name in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), import will have already returned it.
  * The module will exist in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") before the loader executes the module code. This is crucial because the module code may (directly or indirectly) import itself; adding it to [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") beforehand prevents unbounded recursion in the worst case and multiple loading in the best.
  * If loading fails, the failing module – and only the failing module – gets removed from [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"). Any module already in the [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") cache, and any module that was successfully loaded as a side-effect, must remain in the cache. This contrasts with reloading where even the failing module is left in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules").
  * After the module is created but before execution, the import machinery sets the import-related module attributes (“_init_module_attrs” in the pseudo-code example above), as summarized in a [later section](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#import-mod-attrs).
  * Module execution is the key moment of loading in which the module’s namespace gets populated. Execution is entirely delegated to the loader, which gets to decide what gets populated and how.
  * The module created during loading and passed to exec_module() may not be the one returned at the end of import [[2]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#fnlo).


Changed in version 3.4: The import system has taken over the boilerplate responsibilities of loaders. These were previously performed by the [`importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.load_module "importlib.abc.Loader.load_module") method.
###  5.4.1. Loaders[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#loaders "Link to this heading")
Module loaders provide the critical function of loading: module execution. The import machinery calls the [`importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module "importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module") method with a single argument, the module object to execute. Any value returned from [`exec_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module "importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module") is ignored.
Loaders must satisfy the following requirements:
  * If the module is a Python module (as opposed to a built-in module or a dynamically loaded extension), the loader should execute the module’s code in the module’s global name space (`module.__dict__`).
  * If the loader cannot execute the module, it should raise an [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError"), although any other exception raised during [`exec_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module "importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module") will be propagated.


In many cases, the finder and loader can be the same object; in such cases the [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") method would just return a spec with the loader set to `self`.
Module loaders may opt in to creating the module object during loading by implementing a [`create_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.create_module "importlib.abc.Loader.create_module") method. It takes one argument, the module spec, and returns the new module object to use during loading. `create_module()` does not need to set any attributes on the module object. If the method returns `None`, the import machinery will create the new module itself.
Added in version 3.4: The [`create_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.create_module "importlib.abc.Loader.create_module") method of loaders.
Changed in version 3.4: The [`load_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.load_module "importlib.abc.Loader.load_module") method was replaced by [`exec_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module "importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module") and the import machinery assumed all the boilerplate responsibilities of loading.
For compatibility with existing loaders, the import machinery will use the `load_module()` method of loaders if it exists and the loader does not also implement `exec_module()`. However, `load_module()` has been deprecated and loaders should implement `exec_module()` instead.
The `load_module()` method must implement all the boilerplate loading functionality described above in addition to executing the module. All the same constraints apply, with some additional clarification:
  * If there is an existing module object with the given name in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), the loader must use that existing module. (Otherwise, [`importlib.reload()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload "importlib.reload") will not work correctly.) If the named module does not exist in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), the loader must create a new module object and add it to [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules").
  * The module _must_ exist in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules") before the loader executes the module code, to prevent unbounded recursion or multiple loading.
  * If loading fails, the loader must remove any modules it has inserted into [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"), but it must remove **only** the failing module(s), and only if the loader itself has loaded the module(s) explicitly.


Changed in version 3.5: A [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") is raised when `exec_module()` is defined but `create_module()` is not.
Changed in version 3.6: An [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") is raised when `exec_module()` is defined but `create_module()` is not.
Changed in version 3.10: Use of `load_module()` will raise [`ImportWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning").
###  5.4.2. Submodules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#submodules "Link to this heading")
When a submodule is loaded using any mechanism (e.g. `importlib` APIs, the `import` or `import-from` statements, or built-in `__import__()`) a binding is placed in the parent module’s namespace to the submodule object. For example, if package `spam` has a submodule `foo`, after importing `spam.foo`, `spam` will have an attribute `foo` which is bound to the submodule. Let’s say you have the following directory structure:
Copy```
spam/
    __init__.py
    foo.py

```

and `spam/__init__.py` has the following line in it:
Copy```
from.fooimport Foo

```

then executing the following puts name bindings for `foo` and `Foo` in the `spam` module:
Copy```
>>> importspam
>>> spam.foo
<module 'spam.foo' from '/tmp/imports/spam/foo.py'>
>>> spam.Foo
<class 'spam.foo.Foo'>

```

Given Python’s familiar name binding rules this might seem surprising, but it’s actually a fundamental feature of the import system. The invariant holding is that if you have `sys.modules['spam']` and `sys.modules['spam.foo']` (as you would after the above import), the latter must appear as the `foo` attribute of the former.
###  5.4.3. Module specs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#module-specs "Link to this heading")
The import machinery uses a variety of information about each module during import, especially before loading. Most of the information is common to all modules. The purpose of a module’s spec is to encapsulate this import-related information on a per-module basis.
Using a spec during import allows state to be transferred between import system components, e.g. between the finder that creates the module spec and the loader that executes it. Most importantly, it allows the import machinery to perform the boilerplate operations of loading, whereas without a module spec the loader had that responsibility.
The module’s spec is exposed as [`module.__spec__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__spec__ "module.__spec__"). Setting `__spec__` appropriately applies equally to [modules initialized during interpreter startup](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#programs). The one exception is `__main__`, where `__spec__` is [set to None in some cases](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#main-spec).
See [`ModuleSpec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec") for details on the contents of the module spec.
Added in version 3.4.
###  5.4.4. __path__ attributes on modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#path-attributes-on-modules "Link to this heading")
The [`__path__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__path__ "module.__path__") attribute should be a (possibly empty) [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) of strings enumerating the locations where the package’s submodules will be found. By definition, if a module has a `__path__` attribute, it is a [package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package).
A package’s [`__path__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__path__ "module.__path__") attribute is used during imports of its subpackages. Within the import machinery, it functions much the same as [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"), i.e. providing a list of locations to search for modules during import. However, `__path__` is typically much more constrained than `sys.path`.
The same rules used for [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") also apply to a package’s `__path__`. [`sys.path_hooks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_hooks "sys.path_hooks") (described below) are consulted when traversing a package’s `__path__`.
A package’s `__init__.py` file may set or alter the package’s [`__path__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__path__ "module.__path__") attribute, and this was typically the way namespace packages were implemented prior to [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/). With the adoption of [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/), namespace packages no longer need to supply `__init__.py` files containing only `__path__` manipulation code; the import machinery automatically sets `__path__` correctly for the namespace package.
###  5.4.5. Module reprs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#module-reprs "Link to this heading")
By default, all modules have a usable repr, however depending on the attributes set above, and in the module’s spec, you can more explicitly control the repr of module objects.
If the module has a spec (`__spec__`), the import machinery will try to generate a repr from it. If that fails or there is no spec, the import system will craft a default repr using whatever information is available on the module. It will try to use the `module.__name__`, `module.__file__`, and `module.__loader__` as input into the repr, with defaults for whatever information is missing.
Here are the exact rules used:
  * If the module has a `__spec__` attribute, the information in the spec is used to generate the repr. The “name”, “loader”, “origin”, and “has_location” attributes are consulted.
  * If the module has a `__file__` attribute, this is used as part of the module’s repr.
  * If the module has no `__file__` but does have a `__loader__` that is not `None`, then the loader’s repr is used as part of the module’s repr.
  * Otherwise, just use the module’s `__name__` in the repr.


Changed in version 3.12: Use of `module_repr()`, having been deprecated since Python 3.4, was removed in Python 3.12 and is no longer called during the resolution of a module’s repr.
###  5.4.6. Cached bytecode invalidation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#cached-bytecode-invalidation "Link to this heading")
Before Python loads cached bytecode from a `.pyc` file, it checks whether the cache is up-to-date with the source `.py` file. By default, Python does this by storing the source’s last-modified timestamp and size in the cache file when writing it. At runtime, the import system then validates the cache file by checking the stored metadata in the cache file against the source’s metadata.
Python also supports “hash-based” cache files, which store a hash of the source file’s contents rather than its metadata. There are two variants of hash-based `.pyc` files: checked and unchecked. For checked hash-based `.pyc` files, Python validates the cache file by hashing the source file and comparing the resulting hash with the hash in the cache file. If a checked hash-based cache file is found to be invalid, Python regenerates it and writes a new checked hash-based cache file. For unchecked hash-based `.pyc` files, Python simply assumes the cache file is valid if it exists. Hash-based `.pyc` files validation behavior may be overridden with the [`--check-hash-based-pycs`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-check-hash-based-pycs) flag.
Changed in version 3.7: Added hash-based `.pyc` files. Previously, Python only supported timestamp-based invalidation of bytecode caches.
##  5.5. The Path Based Finder[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-path-based-finder "Link to this heading")
As mentioned previously, Python comes with several default meta path finders. One of these, called the [path based finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder) ([`PathFinder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder "importlib.machinery.PathFinder")), searches an [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path), which contains a list of [path entries](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry). Each path entry names a location to search for modules.
The path based finder itself doesn’t know how to import anything. Instead, it traverses the individual path entries, associating each of them with a path entry finder that knows how to handle that particular kind of path.
The default set of path entry finders implement all the semantics for finding modules on the file system, handling special file types such as Python source code (`.py` files), Python byte code (`.pyc` files) and shared libraries (e.g. `.so` files). When supported by the [`zipimport`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.html#module-zipimport "zipimport: Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives.") module in the standard library, the default path entry finders also handle loading all of these file types (other than shared libraries) from zipfiles.
Path entries need not be limited to file system locations. They can refer to URLs, database queries, or any other location that can be specified as a string.
The path based finder provides additional hooks and protocols so that you can extend and customize the types of searchable path entries. For example, if you wanted to support path entries as network URLs, you could write a hook that implements HTTP semantics to find modules on the web. This hook (a callable) would return a [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) supporting the protocol described below, which was then used to get a loader for the module from the web.
A word of warning: this section and the previous both use the term _finder_ , distinguishing between them by using the terms [meta path finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-meta-path-finder) and [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder). These two types of finders are very similar, support similar protocols, and function in similar ways during the import process, but it’s important to keep in mind that they are subtly different. In particular, meta path finders operate at the beginning of the import process, as keyed off the [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path") traversal.
By contrast, path entry finders are in a sense an implementation detail of the path based finder, and in fact, if the path based finder were to be removed from [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path"), none of the path entry finder semantics would be invoked.
###  5.5.1. Path entry finders[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#path-entry-finders "Link to this heading")
The [path based finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder) is responsible for finding and loading Python modules and packages whose location is specified with a string [path entry](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry). Most path entries name locations in the file system, but they need not be limited to this.
As a meta path finder, the [path based finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder) implements the [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") protocol previously described, however it exposes additional hooks that can be used to customize how modules are found and loaded from the [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path).
Three variables are used by the [path based finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder), [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"), [`sys.path_hooks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_hooks "sys.path_hooks") and [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache"). The `__path__` attributes on package objects are also used. These provide additional ways that the import machinery can be customized.
[`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") contains a list of strings providing search locations for modules and packages. It is initialized from the [`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) environment variable and various other installation- and implementation-specific defaults. Entries in [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") can name directories on the file system, zip files, and potentially other “locations” (see the [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") module) that should be searched for modules, such as URLs, or database queries. Only strings should be present on [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"); all other data types are ignored.
The [path based finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder) is a [meta path finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-meta-path-finder), so the import machinery begins the [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path) search by calling the path based finder’s [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec "importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec") method as described previously. When the `path` argument to [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec "importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec") is given, it will be a list of string paths to traverse - typically a package’s `__path__` attribute for an import within that package. If the `path` argument is `None`, this indicates a top level import and [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") is used.
The path based finder iterates over every entry in the search path, and for each of these, looks for an appropriate [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) ([`PathEntryFinder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder "importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder")) for the path entry. Because this can be an expensive operation (e.g. there may be `stat()` call overheads for this search), the path based finder maintains a cache mapping path entries to path entry finders. This cache is maintained in [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache") (despite the name, this cache actually stores finder objects rather than being limited to [importer](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-importer) objects). In this way, the expensive search for a particular [path entry](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry) location’s [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) need only be done once. User code is free to remove cache entries from [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache") forcing the path based finder to perform the path entry search again.
If the path entry is not present in the cache, the path based finder iterates over every callable in [`sys.path_hooks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_hooks "sys.path_hooks"). Each of the [path entry hooks](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-hook) in this list is called with a single argument, the path entry to be searched. This callable may either return a [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) that can handle the path entry, or it may raise [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError"). An [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") is used by the path based finder to signal that the hook cannot find a [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) for that [path entry](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry). The exception is ignored and [import path](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-import-path) iteration continues. The hook should expect either a string or bytes object; the encoding of bytes objects is up to the hook (e.g. it may be a file system encoding, UTF-8, or something else), and if the hook cannot decode the argument, it should raise [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError").
If [`sys.path_hooks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_hooks "sys.path_hooks") iteration ends with no [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) being returned, then the path based finder’s [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec "importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec") method will store `None` in [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache") (to indicate that there is no finder for this path entry) and return `None`, indicating that this [meta path finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-meta-path-finder) could not find the module.
If a [path entry finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder) _is_ returned by one of the [path entry hook](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-hook) callables on [`sys.path_hooks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_hooks "sys.path_hooks"), then the following protocol is used to ask the finder for a module spec, which is then used when loading the module.
The current working directory – denoted by an empty string – is handled slightly differently from other entries on [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"). First, if the current working directory is found to not exist, no value is stored in [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache"). Second, the value for the current working directory is looked up fresh for each module lookup. Third, the path used for [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache") and returned by [`importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec "importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec") will be the actual current working directory and not the empty string.
###  5.5.2. Path entry finder protocol[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#path-entry-finder-protocol "Link to this heading")
In order to support imports of modules and initialized packages and also to contribute portions to namespace packages, path entry finders must implement the [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec") method.
[`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec") takes two arguments: the fully qualified name of the module being imported, and the (optional) target module. `find_spec()` returns a fully populated spec for the module. This spec will always have “loader” set (with one exception).
To indicate to the import machinery that the spec represents a namespace [portion](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-portion), the path entry finder sets `submodule_search_locations` to a list containing the portion.
Changed in version 3.4: [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec") replaced `find_loader()` and `find_module()`, both of which are now deprecated, but will be used if `find_spec()` is not defined.
Older path entry finders may implement one of these two deprecated methods instead of `find_spec()`. The methods are still respected for the sake of backward compatibility. However, if `find_spec()` is implemented on the path entry finder, the legacy methods are ignored.
`find_loader()` takes one argument, the fully qualified name of the module being imported. `find_loader()` returns a 2-tuple where the first item is the loader and the second item is a namespace [portion](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-portion).
For backwards compatibility with other implementations of the import protocol, many path entry finders also support the same, traditional `find_module()` method that meta path finders support. However path entry finder `find_module()` methods are never called with a `path` argument (they are expected to record the appropriate path information from the initial call to the path hook).
The `find_module()` method on path entry finders is deprecated, as it does not allow the path entry finder to contribute portions to namespace packages. If both `find_loader()` and `find_module()` exist on a path entry finder, the import system will always call `find_loader()` in preference to `find_module()`.
Changed in version 3.10: Calls to `find_module()` and `find_loader()` by the import system will raise [`ImportWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning").
Changed in version 3.12: `find_module()` and `find_loader()` have been removed.
##  5.6. Replacing the standard import system[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#replacing-the-standard-import-system "Link to this heading")
The most reliable mechanism for replacing the entire import system is to delete the default contents of [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path"), replacing them entirely with a custom meta path hook.
If it is acceptable to only alter the behaviour of import statements without affecting other APIs that access the import system, then replacing the builtin [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__") function may be sufficient. This technique may also be employed at the module level to only alter the behaviour of import statements within that module.
To selectively prevent the import of some modules from a hook early on the meta path (rather than disabling the standard import system entirely), it is sufficient to raise [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") directly from [`find_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec") instead of returning `None`. The latter indicates that the meta path search should continue, while raising an exception terminates it immediately.
##  5.7. Package Relative Imports[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#package-relative-imports "Link to this heading")
Relative imports use leading dots. A single leading dot indicates a relative import, starting with the current package. Two or more leading dots indicate a relative import to the parent(s) of the current package, one level per dot after the first. For example, given the following package layout:
Copy```
package/
    __init__.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleX.py
        moduleY.py
    subpackage2/
        __init__.py
        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py

```

In either `subpackage1/moduleX.py` or `subpackage1/__init__.py`, the following are valid relative imports:
Copy```
from.moduleYimport spam
from.moduleYimport spam as ham
from.import moduleY
from..subpackage1import moduleY
from..subpackage2.moduleZimport eggs
from..moduleAimport foo

```

Absolute imports may use either the `import <>` or `from <> import <>` syntax, but relative imports may only use the second form; the reason for this is that:
Copy```
importXXX.YYY.ZZZ

```

should expose `XXX.YYY.ZZZ` as a usable expression, but .moduleY is not a valid expression.
##  5.8. Special considerations for __main__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#special-considerations-for-main "Link to this heading")
The [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.") module is a special case relative to Python’s import system. As noted [elsewhere](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#programs), the `__main__` module is directly initialized at interpreter startup, much like [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") and [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."). However, unlike those two, it doesn’t strictly qualify as a built-in module. This is because the manner in which `__main__` is initialized depends on the flags and other options with which the interpreter is invoked.
###  5.8.1. __main__.__spec__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#main-spec "Link to this heading")
Depending on how [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.") is initialized, `__main__.__spec__` gets set appropriately or to `None`.
When Python is started with the [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) option, `__spec__` is set to the module spec of the corresponding module or package. `__spec__` is also populated when the `__main__` module is loaded as part of executing a directory, zipfile or other [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") entry.
In [the remaining cases](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-interface-options) `__main__.__spec__` is set to `None`, as the code used to populate the [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.") does not correspond directly with an importable module:
  * interactive prompt
  * [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) option
  * running from stdin
  * running directly from a source or bytecode file


Note that `__main__.__spec__` is always `None` in the last case, _even if_ the file could technically be imported directly as a module instead. Use the [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) switch if valid module metadata is desired in [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.").
Note also that even when `__main__` corresponds with an importable module and `__main__.__spec__` is set accordingly, they’re still considered _distinct_ modules. This is due to the fact that blocks guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":` checks only execute when the module is used to populate the `__main__` namespace, and not during normal import.
##  5.9. References[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#references "Link to this heading")
The import machinery has evolved considerably since Python’s early days. The original [specification for packages](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/packages/) is still available to read, although some details have changed since the writing of that document.
The original specification for [`sys.meta_path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path") was [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/), with subsequent extension in [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).
[**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) introduced [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace-package) for Python 3.3. [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) also introduced the `find_loader()` protocol as an alternative to `find_module()`.
[**PEP 366**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0366/) describes the addition of the `__package__` attribute for explicit relative imports in main modules.
[**PEP 328**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0328/) introduced absolute and explicit relative imports and initially proposed `__name__` for semantics [**PEP 366**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0366/) would eventually specify for `__package__`.
[**PEP 338**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0338/) defines executing modules as scripts.
[**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/) adds the encapsulation of per-module import state in spec objects. It also off-loads most of the boilerplate responsibilities of loaders back onto the import machinery. These changes allow the deprecation of several APIs in the import system and also addition of new methods to finders and loaders.

The importlib implementation avoids using the return value directly. Instead, it gets the module object by looking the module name up in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"). The indirect effect of this is that an imported module may replace itself in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules"). This is implementation-specific behavior that is not guaranteed to work in other Python implementations.

#  7. Simple statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#simple-statements "Link to this heading")
A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line. Several simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons. The syntax for simple statements is:
```
**simple_stmt** ::= [expression_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression_stmt)
                | [assert_stmt](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-assert_stmt)

```

##  7.1. Expression statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#expression-statements "Link to this heading")
`None`). Other uses of expression statements are allowed and occasionally useful. The syntax for an expression statement is:
```
**expression_stmt** ::= [starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression)

```

An expression statement evaluates the expression list (which may be a single expression).
In interactive mode, if the value is not `None`, it is converted to a string using the built-in [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") function and the resulting string is written to standard output on a line by itself (except if the result is `None`, so that procedure calls do not cause any output.)
##  7.2. Assignment statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements "Link to this heading")
Assignment statements are used to (re)bind names to values and to modify attributes or items of mutable objects:
```
**assignment_stmt** ::= ([target_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target_list) "=")+ ([starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression) | [yield_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_expression))
**target_list**     ::= [target](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target) ("," [target](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target))* [","]
**target**          ::= [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)
                    | "(" [[target_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target_list)] ")"
                    | "[" [[target_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target_list)] "]"
                    | [attributeref](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-attributeref)
                    | [subscription](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-subscription)
                    | [slicing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-slicing)
                    | "*" [target](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target)

```

(See section [Primaries](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#primaries) for the syntax definitions for _attributeref_ , _subscription_ , and _slicing_.)
An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.
Assignment is defined recursively depending on the form of the target (list). When a target is part of a mutable object (an attribute reference, subscription or slicing), the mutable object must ultimately perform the assignment and decide about its validity, and may raise an exception if the assignment is unacceptable. The rules observed by various types and the exceptions raised are given with the definition of the object types (see section [The standard type hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types)).
Assignment of an object to a target list, optionally enclosed in parentheses or square brackets, is recursively defined as follows.
  * If the target list is a single target with no trailing comma, optionally in parentheses, the object is assigned to that target.
  * Else:
    * If the target list contains one target prefixed with an asterisk, called a “starred” target: The object must be an iterable with at least as many items as there are targets in the target list, minus one. The first items of the iterable are assigned, from left to right, to the targets before the starred target. The final items of the iterable are assigned to the targets after the starred target. A list of the remaining items in the iterable is then assigned to the starred target (the list can be empty).
    * Else: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there are targets in the target list, and the items are assigned, from left to right, to the corresponding targets.


Assignment of an object to a single target is recursively defined as follows.
  * If the target is an identifier (name):
    * If the name does not occur in a [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) or [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement in the current code block: the name is bound to the object in the current local namespace.
    * Otherwise: the name is bound to the object in the global namespace or the outer namespace determined by [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal), respectively.
The name is rebound if it was already bound. This may cause the reference count for the object previously bound to the name to reach zero, causing the object to be deallocated and its destructor (if it has one) to be called.
  * If the target is an attribute reference: The primary expression in the reference is evaluated. It should yield an object with assignable attributes; if this is not the case, [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised. That object is then asked to assign the assigned object to the given attribute; if it cannot perform the assignment, it raises an exception (usually but not necessarily [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError")).
Note: If the object is a class instance and the attribute reference occurs on both sides of the assignment operator, the right-hand side expression, `a.x` can access either an instance attribute or (if no instance attribute exists) a class attribute. The left-hand side target `a.x` is always set as an instance attribute, creating it if necessary. Thus, the two occurrences of `a.x` do not necessarily refer to the same attribute: if the right-hand side expression refers to a class attribute, the left-hand side creates a new instance attribute as the target of the assignment:
Copy```
classCls:
    x = 3             # class variable
inst = Cls()
inst.x = inst.x + 1   # writes inst.x as 4 leaving Cls.x as 3

```

This description does not necessarily apply to descriptor attributes, such as properties created with [`property()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property "property").
  * If the target is a subscription: The primary expression in the reference is evaluated. It should yield either a mutable sequence object (such as a list) or a mapping object (such as a dictionary). Next, the subscript expression is evaluated.
If the primary is a mutable sequence object (such as a list), the subscript must yield an integer. If it is negative, the sequence’s length is added to it. The resulting value must be a nonnegative integer less than the sequence’s length, and the sequence is asked to assign the assigned object to its item with that index. If the index is out of range, [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError") is raised (assignment to a subscripted sequence cannot add new items to a list).
If the primary is a mapping object (such as a dictionary), the subscript must have a type compatible with the mapping’s key type, and the mapping is then asked to create a key/value pair which maps the subscript to the assigned object. This can either replace an existing key/value pair with the same key value, or insert a new key/value pair (if no key with the same value existed).
For user-defined objects, the [`__setitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setitem__ "object.__setitem__") method is called with appropriate arguments.
  * If the target is a slicing: The primary expression in the reference is evaluated. It should yield a mutable sequence object (such as a list). The assigned object should be a sequence object of the same type. Next, the lower and upper bound expressions are evaluated, insofar they are present; defaults are zero and the sequence’s length. The bounds should evaluate to integers. If either bound is negative, the sequence’s length is added to it. The resulting bounds are clipped to lie between zero and the sequence’s length, inclusive. Finally, the sequence object is asked to replace the slice with the items of the assigned sequence. The length of the slice may be different from the length of the assigned sequence, thus changing the length of the target sequence, if the target sequence allows it.


**CPython implementation detail:** In the current implementation, the syntax for targets is taken to be the same as for expressions, and invalid syntax is rejected during the code generation phase, causing less detailed error messages.
Although the definition of assignment implies that overlaps between the left-hand side and the right-hand side are ‘simultaneous’ (for example `a, b = b, a` swaps two variables), overlaps _within_ the collection of assigned-to variables occur left-to-right, sometimes resulting in confusion. For instance, the following program prints `[0, 2]`:
Copy```
x = [0, 1]
i = 0
i, x[i] = 1, 2         # i is updated, then x[i] is updated
print(x)

```

###  7.2.1. Augmented assignment statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements "Link to this heading")
Augmented assignment is the combination, in a single statement, of a binary operation and an assignment statement:
```
**augmented_assignment_stmt** ::= [augtarget](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-augtarget) [augop](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-augop) ([expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression_list) | [yield_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_expression))
**augtarget**                 ::= [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) | [attributeref](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-attributeref) | [subscription](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-subscription) | [slicing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-slicing)
**augop**                     ::= "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "@=" | "/=" | "//=" | "%=" | "**="
                              | ">>=" | "<<=" | "&=" | "^=" | "|="

```

(See section [Primaries](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#primaries) for the syntax definitions of the last three symbols.)
An augmented assignment evaluates the target (which, unlike normal assignment statements, cannot be an unpacking) and the expression list, performs the binary operation specific to the type of assignment on the two operands, and assigns the result to the original target. The target is only evaluated once.
An augmented assignment statement like `x += 1` can be rewritten as `x = x + 1` to achieve a similar, but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented version, `x` is only evaluated once. Also, when possible, the actual operation is performed _in-place_ , meaning that rather than creating a new object and assigning that to the target, the old object is modified instead.
Unlike normal assignments, augmented assignments evaluate the left-hand side _before_ evaluating the right-hand side. For example, `a[i] += f(x)` first looks-up `a[i]`, then it evaluates `f(x)` and performs the addition, and lastly, it writes the result back to `a[i]`.
With the exception of assigning to tuples and multiple targets in a single statement, the assignment done by augmented assignment statements is handled the same way as normal assignments. Similarly, with the exception of the possible _in-place_ behavior, the binary operation performed by augmented assignment is the same as the normal binary operations.
For targets which are attribute references, the same [caveat about class and instance attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#attr-target-note) applies as for regular assignments.
###  7.2.2. Annotated assignment statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#annotated-assignment-statements "Link to this heading")
[Annotation](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-variable-annotation) assignment is the combination, in a single statement, of a variable or attribute annotation and an optional assignment statement:
```
**annotated_assignment_stmt** ::= [augtarget](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-augtarget) ":" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)
                              ["=" ([starred_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-starred_expression) | [yield_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_expression))]

```

The difference from normal [Assignment statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment) is that only a single target is allowed.
The assignment target is considered “simple” if it consists of a single name that is not enclosed in parentheses. For simple assignment targets, if in class or module scope, the annotations are evaluated and stored in a special class or module attribute `__annotations__` that is a dictionary mapping from variable names (mangled if private) to evaluated annotations. This attribute is writable and is automatically created at the start of class or module body execution, if annotations are found statically.
If the assignment target is not simple (an attribute, subscript node, or parenthesized name), the annotation is evaluated if in class or module scope, but not stored.
If a name is annotated in a function scope, then this name is local for that scope. Annotations are never evaluated and stored in function scopes.
If the right hand side is present, an annotated assignment performs the actual assignment before evaluating annotations (where applicable). If the right hand side is not present for an expression target, then the interpreter evaluates the target except for the last [`__setitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setitem__ "object.__setitem__") or [`__setattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__ "object.__setattr__") call.
See also 

[**PEP 526**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) - Syntax for Variable Annotations
    
The proposal that added syntax for annotating the types of variables (including class variables and instance variables), instead of expressing them through comments. 

[**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) - Type hints
    
The proposal that added the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\).") module to provide a standard syntax for type annotations that can be used in static analysis tools and IDEs.
Changed in version 3.8: Now annotated assignments allow the same expressions in the right hand side as regular assignments. Previously, some expressions (like un-parenthesized tuple expressions) caused a syntax error.
##  7.3. The `assert` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement "Link to this heading")
Assert statements are a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into a program:
```
**assert_stmt** ::= "assert" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ["," [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)]

```

The simple form, `assert expression`, is equivalent to
Copy```
if __debug__:
    if not expression: raise AssertionError

```

The extended form, `assert expression1, expression2`, is equivalent to
Copy```
if __debug__:
    if not expression1: raise AssertionError(expression2)

```

These equivalences assume that [`__debug__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#debug__ "__debug__") and [`AssertionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError "AssertionError") refer to the built-in variables with those names. In the current implementation, the built-in variable `__debug__` is `True` under normal circumstances, `False` when optimization is requested (command line option [`-O`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O)). The current code generator emits no code for an [`assert`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert) statement when optimization is requested at compile time. Note that it is unnecessary to include the source code for the expression that failed in the error message; it will be displayed as part of the stack trace.
Assignments to [`__debug__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#debug__ "__debug__") are illegal. The value for the built-in variable is determined when the interpreter starts.
##  7.4. The `pass` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-pass-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**pass_stmt** ::= "pass"

```

[`pass`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#pass) is a null operation — when it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed, for example:
Copy```
deff(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

classC: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)

```

##  7.5. The `del` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-del-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**del_stmt** ::= "del" [target_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-target_list)

```

Deletion is recursively defined very similar to the way assignment is defined. Rather than spelling it out in full details, here are some hints.
Deletion of a target list recursively deletes each target, from left to right.
Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or global namespace, depending on whether the name occurs in a [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement in the same code block. Trying to delete an unbound name raises a [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError") exception.
Deletion of attribute references, subscriptions and slicings is passed to the primary object involved; deletion of a slicing is in general equivalent to assignment of an empty slice of the right type (but even this is determined by the sliced object).
Changed in version 3.2: Previously it was illegal to delete a name from the local namespace if it occurs as a free variable in a nested block.
##  7.6. The `return` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-return-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**return_stmt** ::= "return" [[expression_list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression_list)]

```

[`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition, not within a nested class definition.
If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else `None` is substituted.
[`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) leaves the current function call with the expression list (or `None`) as return value.
When [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) passes control out of a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement with a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause, that `finally` clause is executed before really leaving the function.
In a generator function, the [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement indicates that the generator is done and will cause [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") to be raised. The returned value (if any) is used as an argument to construct [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") and becomes the [`StopIteration.value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration.value "StopIteration.value") attribute.
In an asynchronous generator function, an empty [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement indicates that the asynchronous generator is done and will cause [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") to be raised. A non-empty `return` statement is a syntax error in an asynchronous generator function.
##  7.7. The `yield` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-yield-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**yield_stmt** ::= [yield_expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_expression)

```

A [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) statement is semantically equivalent to a [yield expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr). The `yield` statement can be used to omit the parentheses that would otherwise be required in the equivalent yield expression statement. For example, the yield statements
Copy```
yield <expr>
yield from <expr>

```

are equivalent to the yield expression statements
Copy```
(yield <expr>)
(yield from <expr>)

```

Yield expressions and statements are only used when defining a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) function, and are only used in the body of the generator function. Using [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) in a function definition is sufficient to cause that definition to create a generator function instead of a normal function.
For full details of [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) semantics, refer to the [Yield expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr) section.
##  7.8. The `raise` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**raise_stmt** ::= "raise" [[expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) ["from" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)]]

```

If no expressions are present, [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) re-raises the exception that is currently being handled, which is also known as the _active exception_. If there isn’t currently an active exception, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") exception is raised indicating that this is an error.
Otherwise, [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) evaluates the first expression as the exception object. It must be either a subclass or an instance of [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException"). If it is a class, the exception instance will be obtained when needed by instantiating the class with no arguments.
The _type_ of the exception is the exception instance’s class, the _value_ is the instance itself.
A traceback object is normally created automatically when an exception is raised and attached to it as the [`__traceback__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__traceback__ "BaseException.__traceback__") attribute. You can create an exception and set your own traceback in one step using the [`with_traceback()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.with_traceback "BaseException.with_traceback") exception method (which returns the same exception instance, with its traceback set to its argument), like so:
Copy```
raise Exception("foo occurred").with_traceback(tracebackobj)

```

The `from` clause is used for exception chaining: if given, the second _expression_ must be another exception class or instance. If the second expression is an exception instance, it will be attached to the raised exception as the [`__cause__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__cause__ "BaseException.__cause__") attribute (which is writable). If the expression is an exception class, the class will be instantiated and the resulting exception instance will be attached to the raised exception as the `__cause__` attribute. If the raised exception is not handled, both exceptions will be printed:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     print(1 / 0)
... except Exception as exc:
...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") fromexc
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
print(1 / 0)
~~^~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") fromexc
RuntimeError: Something bad happened

```

A similar mechanism works implicitly if a new exception is raised when an exception is already being handled. An exception may be handled when an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) or [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause, or a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement, is used. The previous exception is then attached as the new exception’s [`__context__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__context__ "BaseException.__context__") attribute:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     print(1 / 0)
... except:
...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
print(1 / 0)
~~^~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened")
RuntimeError: Something bad happened

```

Exception chaining can be explicitly suppressed by specifying [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") in the `from` clause:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     print(1 / 0)
... except:
...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") fromNone
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
RuntimeError: Something bad happened

```

Additional information on exceptions can be found in section [Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#exceptions), and information about handling exceptions is in section [The try statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try).
Changed in version 3.3: [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") is now permitted as `Y` in `raise X from Y`.
Added the [`__suppress_context__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__suppress_context__ "BaseException.__suppress_context__") attribute to suppress automatic display of the exception context.
Changed in version 3.11: If the traceback of the active exception is modified in an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause, a subsequent `raise` statement re-raises the exception with the modified traceback. Previously, the exception was re-raised with the traceback it had when it was caught.
##  7.9. The `break` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-break-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**break_stmt** ::= "break"

```

[`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) may only occur syntactically nested in a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) or [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within that loop.
It terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional `else` clause if the loop has one.
If a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) loop is terminated by [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), the loop control target keeps its current value.
When [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) passes control out of a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement with a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause, that `finally` clause is executed before really leaving the loop.
##  7.10. The `continue` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-continue-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**continue_stmt** ::= "continue"

```

[`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) may only occur syntactically nested in a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) or [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within that loop. It continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.
When [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) passes control out of a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement with a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause, that `finally` clause is executed before really starting the next loop cycle.
##  7.11. The `import` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**import_stmt**     ::= "import" [module](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-module) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)] ("," [module](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-module) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)])*

                    ("," [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)])* [","] ")"
                    | "from" [relative_module](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-relative_module) "import" "*"
**module**          ::= ([identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) ".")* [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)
**relative_module** ::= "."* [module](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-module) | "."+

```

The basic import statement (no [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#from) clause) is executed in two steps:
  1. find a module, loading and initializing it if necessary
  2. define a name or names in the local namespace for the scope where the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement occurs.


When the statement contains multiple clauses (separated by commas) the two steps are carried out separately for each clause, just as though the clauses had been separated out into individual import statements.
The details of the first step, finding and loading modules, are described in greater detail in the section on the [import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#importsystem), which also describes the various types of packages and modules that can be imported, as well as all the hooks that can be used to customize the import system. Note that failures in this step may indicate either that the module could not be located, _or_ that an error occurred while initializing the module, which includes execution of the module’s code.
If the requested module is retrieved successfully, it will be made available in the local namespace in one of three ways:
  * If the module name is followed by `as`, then the name following `as` is bound directly to the imported module.
  * If no other name is specified, and the module being imported is a top level module, the module’s name is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the imported module
  * If the module being imported is _not_ a top level module, then the name of the top level package that contains the module is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the top level package. The imported module must be accessed using its full qualified name rather than directly


The [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#from) form uses a slightly more complex process:
  1. find the module specified in the [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#from) clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;
  2. for each of the identifiers specified in the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) clauses:
    1. check if the imported module has an attribute by that name
    2. if not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attribute
    3. if the attribute is not found, [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") is raised.
    4. otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the `as` clause if it is present, otherwise using the attribute name


Examples:
Copy```
importfoo                 # foo imported and bound locally
importfoo.bar.baz         # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo bound locally
importfoo.bar.bazasfbb  # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo.bar.baz bound as fbb
fromfoo.barimport baz    # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo.bar.baz bound as baz
fromfooimport attr       # foo imported and foo.attr bound as attr

```

If the list of identifiers is replaced by a star (`'*'`), all public names defined in the module are bound in the local namespace for the scope where the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement occurs.
_public names_ defined by a module are determined by checking the module’s namespace for a variable named `__all__`; if defined, it must be a sequence of strings which are names defined or imported by that module. The names given in `__all__` are all considered public and are required to exist. If `__all__` is not defined, the set of public names includes all names found in the module’s namespace which do not begin with an underscore character (`'_'`). `__all__` should contain the entire public API. It is intended to avoid accidentally exporting items that are not part of the API (such as library modules which were imported and used within the module).
The wild card form of import — `from module import *` — is only allowed at the module level. Attempting to use it in class or function definitions will raise a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError").
When specifying what module to import you do not have to specify the absolute name of the module. When a module or package is contained within another package it is possible to make a relative import within the same top package without having to mention the package name. By using leading dots in the specified module or package after [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#from) you can specify how high to traverse up the current package hierarchy without specifying exact names. One leading dot means the current package where the module making the import exists. Two dots means up one package level. Three dots is up two levels, etc. So if you execute `from . import mod` from a module in the `pkg` package then you will end up importing `pkg.mod`. If you execute `from ..subpkg2 import mod` from within `pkg.subpkg1` you will import `pkg.subpkg2.mod`. The specification for relative imports is contained in the [Package Relative Imports](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#relativeimports) section.
[`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module "importlib.import_module") is provided to support applications that determine dynamically the modules to be loaded.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `import` with arguments `module`, `filename`, `sys.path`, `sys.meta_path`, `sys.path_hooks`.
###  7.11.1. Future statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#future-statements "Link to this heading")
A _future statement_ is a directive to the compiler that a particular module should be compiled using syntax or semantics that will be available in a specified future release of Python where the feature becomes standard.
The future statement is intended to ease migration to future versions of Python that introduce incompatible changes to the language. It allows use of the new features on a per-module basis before the release in which the feature becomes standard.
```
**future_stmt** ::= "from" "__future__" "import" [feature](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-feature) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)]
                ("," [feature](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-feature) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)])*
                | "from" "__future__" "import" "(" [feature](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-feature) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)]
                ("," [feature](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-feature) ["as" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)])* [","] ")"
**feature**     ::= [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier)

```

A future statement must appear near the top of the module. The only lines that can appear before a future statement are:
  * the module docstring (if any),
  * comments,
  * blank lines, and
  * other future statements.


The only feature that requires using the future statement is `annotations` (see [**PEP 563**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/)).
All historical features enabled by the future statement are still recognized by Python 3. The list includes `absolute_import`, `division`, `generators`, `generator_stop`, `unicode_literals`, `print_function`, `nested_scopes` and `with_statement`. They are all redundant because they are always enabled, and only kept for backwards compatibility.
A future statement is recognized and treated specially at compile time: Changes to the semantics of core constructs are often implemented by generating different code. It may even be the case that a new feature introduces new incompatible syntax (such as a new reserved word), in which case the compiler may need to parse the module differently. Such decisions cannot be pushed off until runtime.
For any given release, the compiler knows which feature names have been defined, and raises a compile-time error if a future statement contains a feature not known to it.
The direct runtime semantics are the same as for any import statement: there is a standard module [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions"), described later, and it will be imported in the usual way at the time the future statement is executed.
The interesting runtime semantics depend on the specific feature enabled by the future statement.
Note that there is nothing special about the statement:
Copy```
import__future__ [as name]

```

That is not a future statement; it’s an ordinary import statement with no special semantics or syntax restrictions.
Code compiled by calls to the built-in functions [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") and [`compile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile "compile") that occur in a module `M` containing a future statement will, by default, use the new syntax or semantics associated with the future statement. This can be controlled by optional arguments to [`compile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile "compile") — see the documentation of that function for details.
A future statement typed at an interactive interpreter prompt will take effect for the rest of the interpreter session. If an interpreter is started with the [`-i`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-i) option, is passed a script name to execute, and the script includes a future statement, it will be in effect in the interactive session started after the script is executed.

The original proposal for the __future__ mechanism.
##  7.12. The `global` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**global_stmt** ::= "global" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) ("," [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier))*

```

The [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement causes the listed identifiers to be interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without `global`, although free variables may refer to globals without being declared global.
The `global` statement applies to the entire current scope (module, function body or class definition). A [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") is raised if a variable is used or assigned to prior to its global declaration in the scope.
At the module level, all variables are global, so a `global` statement has no effect. However, variables must still not be used or assigned to prior to their `global` declaration. This requirement is relaxed in the interactive prompt ([REPL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-REPL)).
**Programmer’s note:** [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) is a directive to the parser. It applies only to code parsed at the same time as the `global` statement. In particular, a `global` statement contained in a string or code object supplied to the built-in [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") function does not affect the code block _containing_ the function call, and code contained in such a string is unaffected by `global` statements in the code containing the function call. The same applies to the [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") and [`compile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile "compile") functions.
##  7.13. The `nonlocal` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-nonlocal-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**nonlocal_stmt** ::= "nonlocal" [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) ("," [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier))*

```

When the definition of a function or class is nested (enclosed) within the definitions of other functions, its nonlocal scopes are the local scopes of the enclosing functions. The [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to names previously bound in nonlocal scopes. It allows encapsulated code to rebind such nonlocal identifiers. If a name is bound in more than one nonlocal scope, the nearest binding is used. If a name is not bound in any nonlocal scope, or if there is no nonlocal scope, a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") is raised.
The [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement applies to the entire scope of a function or class body. A [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") is raised if a variable is used or assigned to prior to its nonlocal declaration in the scope.
See also 

[**PEP 3104**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3104/) - Access to Names in Outer Scopes
    
The specification for the [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement.
**Programmer’s note:** [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) is a directive to the parser and applies only to code parsed along with it. See the note for the [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement.
##  7.14. The `type` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-type-statement "Link to this heading")
```
**type_stmt** ::= 'type' [identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-identifier) [[type_params](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-type_params)] "=" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)

```

The `type` statement declares a type alias, which is an instance of [`typing.TypeAliasType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType").
For example, the following statement creates a type alias:
Copy```
type Point = tuple[float, float]

```

This code is roughly equivalent to:
Copy```
annotation-defVALUE_OF_Point():
    return tuple[float, float]
Point = typing.TypeAliasType("Point", VALUE_OF_Point())

```

`annotation-def` indicates an [annotation scope](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes), which behaves mostly like a function, but with several small differences.
The value of the type alias is evaluated in the annotation scope. It is not evaluated when the type alias is created, but only when the value is accessed through the type alias’s `__value__` attribute (see [Lazy evaluation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation)). This allows the type alias to refer to names that are not yet defined.
Type aliases may be made generic by adding a [type parameter list](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) after the name. See [Generic type aliases](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-type-aliases) for more.
`type` is a [soft keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords).
Added in version 3.12.

#  3. Data model[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#data-model "Link to this heading")
##  3.1. Objects, values and types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types "Link to this heading")
_Objects_ are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored program computer”, code is also represented by objects.)
Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s _identity_ never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The [`is`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is) operator compares the identity of two objects; the [`id()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id "id") function returns an integer representing its identity.
**CPython implementation detail:** For CPython, `id(x)` is the memory address where `x` is stored.
An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") function returns an object’s type (which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s _type_ is also unchangeable. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id19)
The _value_ of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be _mutable_ ; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called _immutable_. (The value of an immutable container object that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects it contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more subtle.) An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable.
Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether — it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented, as long as no objects are collected that are still reachable.
**CPython implementation detail:** CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references. See the documentation of the [`gc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#module-gc "gc: Interface to the cycle-detecting garbage collector.") module for information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage. Other implementations act differently and CPython may change. Do not depend on immediate finalization of objects when they become unreachable (so you should always close files explicitly).
Note that the use of the implementation’s tracing or debugging facilities may keep objects alive that would normally be collectable. Also note that catching an exception with a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)…[`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) statement may keep objects alive.
Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a `close()` method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects. The [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)…[`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) statement and the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement provide convenient ways to do this.
Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called _containers_. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a container’s value. In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied. So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed.
Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior. Even the importance of object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations that compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing object with the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is not allowed. For example, after `a = 1; b = 1`, _a_ and _b_ may or may not refer to the same object with the value one, depending on the implementation. This is because [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") is an immutable type, so the reference to `1` can be reused. This behaviour depends on the implementation used, so should not be relied upon, but is something to be aware of when making use of object identity tests. However, after `c = []; d = []`, _c_ and _d_ are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly created empty lists. (Note that `e = f = []` assigns the _same_ object to both _e_ and _f_.)
##  3.2. The standard type hierarchy[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy "Link to this heading")
Below is a list of the types that are built into Python. Extension modules (written in C, Java, or other languages, depending on the implementation) can define additional types. Future versions of Python may add types to the type hierarchy (e.g., rational numbers, efficiently stored arrays of integers, etc.), although such additions will often be provided via the standard library instead.
Some of the type descriptions below contain a paragraph listing ‘special attributes.’ These are attributes that provide access to the implementation and are not intended for general use. Their definition may change in the future.
###  3.2.1. None[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#none "Link to this heading")
This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the built-in name `None`. It is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g., it is returned from functions that don’t explicitly return anything. Its truth value is false.
###  3.2.2. NotImplemented[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#notimplemented "Link to this heading")
This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the built-in name [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented"). Numeric methods and rich comparison methods should return this value if they do not implement the operation for the operands provided. (The interpreter will then try the reflected operation, or some other fallback, depending on the operator.) It should not be evaluated in a boolean context.
See [Implementing the arithmetic operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#implementing-the-arithmetic-operations) for more details.
Changed in version 3.9: Evaluating [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") in a boolean context is deprecated. While it currently evaluates as true, it will emit a [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning"). It will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") in a future version of Python.
###  3.2.3. Ellipsis[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#ellipsis "Link to this heading")
This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the literal `...` or the built-in name `Ellipsis`. Its truth value is true.
###  3.2.4. [`numbers.Number`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Number "numbers.Number")[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#numbers-number "Link to this heading")
These are created by numeric literals and returned as results by arithmetic operators and arithmetic built-in functions. Numeric objects are immutable; once created their value never changes. Python numbers are of course strongly related to mathematical numbers, but subject to the limitations of numerical representation in computers.
The string representations of the numeric classes, computed by [`__repr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "object.__repr__") and [`__str__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "object.__str__"), have the following properties:
  * They are valid numeric literals which, when passed to their class constructor, produce an object having the value of the original numeric.
  * The representation is in base 10, when possible.
  * Leading zeros, possibly excepting a single zero before a decimal point, are not shown.
  * Trailing zeros, possibly excepting a single zero after a decimal point, are not shown.
  * A sign is shown only when the number is negative.


Python distinguishes between integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers:
####  3.2.4.1. [`numbers.Integral`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Integral "numbers.Integral")[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#numbers-integral "Link to this heading")
These represent elements from the mathematical set of integers (positive and negative).
Note
The rules for integer representation are intended to give the most meaningful interpretation of shift and mask operations involving negative integers.
There are two types of integers: 

Integers ([`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"))
    
These represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only. For the purpose of shift and mask operations, a binary representation is assumed, and negative numbers are represented in a variant of 2’s complement which gives the illusion of an infinite string of sign bits extending to the left. 

Booleans ([`bool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "bool"))
    
These represent the truth values False and True. The two objects representing the values `False` and `True` are the only Boolean objects. The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts, the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings `"False"` or `"True"` are returned, respectively.
####  3.2.4.2. [`numbers.Real`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Real "numbers.Real") ([`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float"))[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#numbers-real-float "Link to this heading")
These represent machine-level double precision floating-point numbers. You are at the mercy of the underlying machine architecture (and C or Java implementation) for the accepted range and handling of overflow. Python does not support single-precision floating-point numbers; the savings in processor and memory usage that are usually the reason for using these are dwarfed by the overhead of using objects in Python, so there is no reason to complicate the language with two kinds of floating-point numbers.
####  3.2.4.3. [`numbers.Complex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Complex "numbers.Complex") ([`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex "complex"))[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#numbers-complex-complex "Link to this heading")
These represent complex numbers as a pair of machine-level double precision floating-point numbers. The same caveats apply as for floating-point numbers. The real and imaginary parts of a complex number `z` can be retrieved through the read-only attributes `z.real` and `z.imag`.
###  3.2.5. Sequences[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#sequences "Link to this heading")
These represent finite ordered sets indexed by non-negative numbers. The built-in function [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") returns the number of items of a sequence. When the length of a sequence is _n_ , the index set contains the numbers 0, 1, …, _n_ -1. Item _i_ of sequence _a_ is selected by `a[i]`. Some sequences, including built-in sequences, interpret negative subscripts by adding the sequence length. For example, `a[-2]` equals `a[n-2]`, the second to last item of sequence a with length `n`.
Sequences also support slicing: `a[i:j]` selects all items with index _k_ such that _i_ `<=` _k_ `<` _j_. When used as an expression, a slice is a sequence of the same type. The comment above about negative indexes also applies to negative slice positions.
Some sequences also support “extended slicing” with a third “step” parameter: `a[i:j:k]` selects all items of _a_ with index _x_ where `x = i + n*k`, _n_ `>=` `0` and _i_ `<=` _x_ `<` _j_.
Sequences are distinguished according to their mutability:
####  3.2.5.1. Immutable sequences[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#immutable-sequences "Link to this heading")
An object of an immutable sequence type cannot change once it is created. (If the object contains references to other objects, these other objects may be mutable and may be changed; however, the collection of objects directly referenced by an immutable object cannot change.)
The following types are immutable sequences: 

Strings
    
A string is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points. All the code points in the range `U+0000 - U+10FFFF` can be represented in a string. Python doesn’t have a char type; instead, every code point in the string is represented as a string object with length `1`. The built-in function [`ord()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord "ord") converts a code point from its string form to an integer in the range `0 - 10FFFF`; [`chr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr "chr") converts an integer in the range `0 - 10FFFF` to the corresponding length `1` string object. [`str.encode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encode "str.encode") can be used to convert a [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") to [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") using the given text encoding, and [`bytes.decode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode "bytes.decode") can be used to achieve the opposite. 

Tuples
    
The items of a tuple are arbitrary Python objects. Tuples of two or more items are formed by comma-separated lists of expressions. A tuple of one item (a ‘singleton’) can be formed by affixing a comma to an expression (an expression by itself does not create a tuple, since parentheses must be usable for grouping of expressions). An empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of parentheses. 

Bytes
    
A bytes object is an immutable array. The items are 8-bit bytes, represented by integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. Bytes literals (like `b'abc'`) and the built-in [`bytes()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") constructor can be used to create bytes objects. Also, bytes objects can be decoded to strings via the [`decode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode "bytes.decode") method.
####  3.2.5.2. Mutable sequences[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#mutable-sequences "Link to this heading")
Mutable sequences can be changed after they are created. The subscription and slicing notations can be used as the target of assignment and [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) (delete) statements.
Note
[`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") and [`array`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.") module provide additional examples of mutable sequence types.
There are currently two intrinsic mutable sequence types: 

Lists
    
The items of a list are arbitrary Python objects. Lists are formed by placing a comma-separated list of expressions in square brackets. (Note that there are no special cases needed to form lists of length 0 or 1.) 

Byte Arrays
    
A bytearray object is a mutable array. They are created by the built-in [`bytearray()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray") constructor. Aside from being mutable (and hence unhashable), byte arrays otherwise provide the same interface and functionality as immutable [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") objects.
###  3.2.6. Set types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#set-types "Link to this heading")
These represent unordered, finite sets of unique, immutable objects. As such, they cannot be indexed by any subscript. However, they can be iterated over, and the built-in function [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") returns the number of items in a set. Common uses for sets are fast membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.
For set elements, the same immutability rules apply as for dictionary keys. Note that numeric types obey the normal rules for numeric comparison: if two numbers compare equal (e.g., `1` and `1.0`), only one of them can be contained in a set.
There are currently two intrinsic set types: 

Sets
    
These represent a mutable set. They are created by the built-in [`set()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") constructor and can be modified afterwards by several methods, such as `add()`. 

Frozen sets
    
These represent an immutable set. They are created by the built-in [`frozenset()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset") constructor. As a frozenset is immutable and [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable), it can be used again as an element of another set, or as a dictionary key.
###  3.2.7. Mappings[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#mappings "Link to this heading")
These represent finite sets of objects indexed by arbitrary index sets. The subscript notation `a[k]` selects the item indexed by `k` from the mapping `a`; this can be used in expressions and as the target of assignments or [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) statements. The built-in function [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") returns the number of items in a mapping.
There is currently a single intrinsic mapping type:
####  3.2.7.1. Dictionaries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#dictionaries "Link to this heading")
These represent finite sets of objects indexed by nearly arbitrary values. The only types of values not acceptable as keys are values containing lists or dictionaries or other mutable types that are compared by value rather than by object identity, the reason being that the efficient implementation of dictionaries requires a key’s hash value to remain constant. Numeric types used for keys obey the normal rules for numeric comparison: if two numbers compare equal (e.g., `1` and `1.0`) then they can be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry.
Dictionaries preserve insertion order, meaning that keys will be produced in the same order they were added sequentially over the dictionary. Replacing an existing key does not change the order, however removing a key and re-inserting it will add it to the end instead of keeping its old place.
Dictionaries are mutable; they can be created by the `{}` notation (see section [Dictionary displays](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dict)).
The extension modules [`dbm.ndbm`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dbm.html#module-dbm.ndbm "dbm.ndbm: The New Database Manager \(Unix\)") and [`dbm.gnu`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dbm.html#module-dbm.gnu "dbm.gnu: GNU database manager \(Unix\)") provide additional examples of mapping types, as does the [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") module.
Changed in version 3.7: Dictionaries did not preserve insertion order in versions of Python before 3.6. In CPython 3.6, insertion order was preserved, but it was considered an implementation detail at that time rather than a language guarantee.
###  3.2.8. Callable types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#callable-types "Link to this heading")
These are the types to which the function call operation (see section [Calls](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls)) can be applied:
####  3.2.8.1. User-defined functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-functions "Link to this heading")
A user-defined function object is created by a function definition (see section [Function definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function)). It should be called with an argument list containing the same number of items as the function’s formal parameter list.
#####  3.2.8.1.1. Special read-only attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-read-only-attributes "Link to this heading")
Attribute | Meaning  
---|--- 

function.__globals__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__globals__ "Link to this definition") 
| A reference to the [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") that holds the function’s [global variables](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming) – the global namespace of the module in which the function was defined. 

function.__closure__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__closure__ "Link to this definition") 
|  `None` or a [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") of cells that contain bindings for the names specified in the [`co_freevars`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_freevars "codeobject.co_freevars") attribute of the function’s [`code object`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__code__ "function.__code__"). A cell object has the attribute `cell_contents`. This can be used to get the value of the cell, as well as set the value.  
#####  3.2.8.1.2. Special writable attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-writable-attributes "Link to this heading")
Most of these attributes check the type of the assigned value:
Attribute | Meaning  
---|--- 

function.__doc__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__doc__ "Link to this definition") 
| The function’s documentation string, or `None` if unavailable. 

function.__name__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__name__ "Link to this definition") 
| The function’s name. See also: [`__name__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__name__ "definition.__name__"). 

function.__qualname__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__qualname__ "Link to this definition") 
|  The function’s [qualified name](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-qualified-name). See also: [`__qualname__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__qualname__ "definition.__qualname__"). Added in version 3.3. 

function.__module__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__module__ "Link to this definition") 
| The name of the module the function was defined in, or `None` if unavailable. 

function.__defaults__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__defaults__ "Link to this definition") 
| A [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing default [parameter](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter) values for those parameters that have defaults, or `None` if no parameters have a default value. 

function.__code__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__code__ "Link to this definition") 
| The [code object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#code-objects) representing the compiled function body. 

function.__dict__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__dict__ "Link to this definition") 
| The namespace supporting arbitrary function attributes. See also: [`__dict__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__").

| A [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") containing annotations of [parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter). The keys of the dictionary are the parameter names, and `'return'` for the return annotation, if provided. See also: [Annotations Best Practices](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#annotations-howto). 

function.__kwdefaults__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__kwdefaults__ "Link to this definition") 
| A [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") containing defaults for keyword-only [parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter). 

function.__type_params__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__type_params__ "Link to this definition") 
|  A [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing the [type parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) of a [generic function](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions). Added in version 3.12.  
Function objects also support getting and setting arbitrary attributes, which can be used, for example, to attach metadata to functions. Regular attribute dot-notation is used to get and set such attributes.
**CPython implementation detail:** CPython’s current implementation only supports function attributes on user-defined functions. Function attributes on [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#builtin-functions) may be supported in the future.
Additional information about a function’s definition can be retrieved from its [code object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#code-objects) (accessible via the [`__code__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__code__ "function.__code__") attribute).
####  3.2.8.2. Instance methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#instance-methods "Link to this heading")
An instance method object combines a class, a class instance and any callable object (normally a user-defined function).
Special read-only attributes: 

method.__self__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "Link to this definition") 
| Refers to the class instance object to which the method is [bound](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method-binding)  
---|--- 

method.__func__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__func__ "Link to this definition") 
| Refers to the original [function object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-funcs) 

method.__doc__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__doc__ "Link to this definition") 
| The method’s documentation (same as [`method.__func__.__doc__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__doc__ "function.__doc__")). A [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") if the original function had a docstring, else `None`. 

method.__name__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__name__ "Link to this definition") 
| The name of the method (same as [`method.__func__.__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__name__ "function.__name__")) 

method.__module__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__module__ "Link to this definition") 
| The name of the module the method was defined in, or `None` if unavailable.  
Methods also support accessing (but not setting) the arbitrary function attributes on the underlying [function object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-funcs).
User-defined method objects may be created when getting an attribute of a class (perhaps via an instance of that class), if that attribute is a user-defined [function object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-funcs) or a [`classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod") object.
When an instance method object is created by retrieving a user-defined [function object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-funcs) from a class via one of its instances, its [`__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__") attribute is the instance, and the method object is said to be _bound_. The new method’s [`__func__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__func__ "method.__func__") attribute is the original function object.
When an instance method object is created by retrieving a [`classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod") object from a class or instance, its [`__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__") attribute is the class itself, and its [`__func__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__func__ "method.__func__") attribute is the function object underlying the class method.
When an instance method object is called, the underlying function ([`__func__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__func__ "method.__func__")) is called, inserting the class instance ([`__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__")) in front of the argument list. For instance, when `C` is a class which contains a definition for a function `f()`, and `x` is an instance of `C`, calling `x.f(1)` is equivalent to calling `C.f(x, 1)`.
When an instance method object is derived from a [`classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod") object, the “class instance” stored in [`__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__") will actually be the class itself, so that calling either `x.f(1)` or `C.f(1)` is equivalent to calling `f(C,1)` where `f` is the underlying function.
It is important to note that user-defined functions which are attributes of a class instance are not converted to bound methods; this _only_ happens when the function is an attribute of the class.
####  3.2.8.3. Generator functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#generator-functions "Link to this heading")
A function or method which uses the [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) statement (see section [The yield statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield)) is called a _generator function_. Such a function, when called, always returns an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator) object which can be used to execute the body of the function: calling the iterator’s [`iterator.__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__ "iterator.__next__") method will cause the function to execute until it provides a value using the `yield` statement. When the function executes a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement or falls off the end, a [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception is raised and the iterator will have reached the end of the set of values to be returned.
####  3.2.8.4. Coroutine functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine-functions "Link to this heading")
A function or method which is defined using [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) is called a _coroutine function_. Such a function, when called, returns a [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine) object. It may contain [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await) expressions, as well as [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with) and [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) statements. See also the [Coroutine Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine-objects) section.
####  3.2.8.5. Asynchronous generator functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-generator-functions "Link to this heading")
A function or method which is defined using [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) and which uses the [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) statement is called a _asynchronous generator function_. Such a function, when called, returns an [asynchronous iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator) object which can be used in an [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) statement to execute the body of the function.
Calling the asynchronous iterator’s [`aiterator.__anext__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__anext__ "object.__anext__") method will return an [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) which when awaited will execute until it provides a value using the [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) expression. When the function executes an empty [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement or falls off the end, a [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") exception is raised and the asynchronous iterator will have reached the end of the set of values to be yielded.
####  3.2.8.6. Built-in functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#built-in-functions "Link to this heading")
A built-in function object is a wrapper around a C function. Examples of built-in functions are [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") and [`math.sin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.sin "math.sin") ([`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math "math: Mathematical functions \(sin\(\) etc.\).") is a standard built-in module). The number and type of the arguments are determined by the C function. Special read-only attributes:
  * `__doc__` is the function’s documentation string, or `None` if unavailable. See [`function.__doc__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__doc__ "function.__doc__").
  * `__name__` is the function’s name. See [`function.__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__name__ "function.__name__").
  * `__self__` is set to `None` (but see the next item).
  * `__module__` is the name of the module the function was defined in or `None` if unavailable. See [`function.__module__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__module__ "function.__module__").


####  3.2.8.7. Built-in methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#built-in-methods "Link to this heading")
This is really a different disguise of a built-in function, this time containing an object passed to the C function as an implicit extra argument. An example of a built-in method is `alist.append()`, assuming _alist_ is a list object. In this case, the special read-only attribute `__self__` is set to the object denoted by _alist_. (The attribute has the same semantics as it does with [`other instance methods`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__").)
####  3.2.8.8. Classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classes "Link to this heading")
Classes are callable. These objects normally act as factories for new instances of themselves, but variations are possible for class types that override [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__"). The arguments of the call are passed to `__new__()` and, in the typical case, to [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") to initialize the new instance.
####  3.2.8.9. Class Instances[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#class-instances "Link to this heading")
Instances of arbitrary classes can be made callable by defining a [`__call__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__ "object.__call__") method in their class.
###  3.2.9. Modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#modules "Link to this heading")
Modules are a basic organizational unit of Python code, and are created by the [import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#importsystem) as invoked either by the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement, or by calling functions such as [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module "importlib.import_module") and built-in [`__import__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__ "__import__"). A module object has a namespace implemented by a [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") object (this is the dictionary referenced by the [`__globals__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__globals__ "function.__globals__") attribute of functions defined in the module). Attribute references are translated to lookups in this dictionary, e.g., `m.x` is equivalent to `m.__dict__["x"]`. A module object does not contain the code object used to initialize the module (since it isn’t needed once the initialization is done).
Attribute assignment updates the module’s namespace dictionary, e.g., `m.x = 1` is equivalent to `m.__dict__["x"] = 1`.
####  3.2.9.1. Import-related attributes on module objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#import-related-attributes-on-module-objects "Link to this heading")
Module objects have the following attributes that relate to the [import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#importsystem). When a module is created using the machinery associated with the import system, these attributes are filled in based on the module’s [spec](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module-spec), before the [loader](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader) executes and loads the module.
To create a module dynamically rather than using the import system, it’s recommended to use [`importlib.util.module_from_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.module_from_spec "importlib.util.module_from_spec"), which will set the various import-controlled attributes to appropriate values. It’s also possible to use the [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType "types.ModuleType") constructor to create modules directly, but this technique is more error-prone, as most attributes must be manually set on the module object after it has been created when using this approach.
Caution
With the exception of [`__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__name__ "module.__name__"), it is **strongly** recommended that you rely on [`__spec__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__spec__ "module.__spec__") and its attributes instead of any of the other individual attributes listed in this subsection. Note that updating an attribute on `__spec__` will not update the corresponding attribute on the module itself:
Copy```
>>> importtyping
>>> typing.__name__, typing.__spec__.name
('typing', 'typing')
>>> typing.__spec__.name = 'spelling'
>>> typing.__name__, typing.__spec__.name
('typing', 'spelling')
>>> typing.__name__ = 'keyboard_smashing'
>>> typing.__name__, typing.__spec__.name
('keyboard_smashing', 'spelling')

```


module.__name__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__name__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The name used to uniquely identify the module in the import system. For a directly executed module, this will be set to `"__main__"`.
This attribute must be set to the fully qualified name of the module. It is expected to match the value of [`module.__spec__.name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.name "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.name"). 

module.__spec__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__spec__ "Link to this definition") 
    
A record of the module’s import-system-related state.
Set to the [`module spec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec") that was used when importing the module. See [Module specs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#module-specs) for more details.
Added in version 3.4. 

module.__package__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__package__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The [package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package) a module belongs to.
If the module is top-level (that is, not a part of any specific package) then the attribute should be set to `''` (the empty string). Otherwise, it should be set to the name of the module’s package (which can be equal to [`module.__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__name__ "module.__name__") if the module itself is a package). See [**PEP 366**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0366/) for further details.
This attribute is used instead of [`__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__name__ "module.__name__") to calculate explicit relative imports for main modules. It defaults to `None` for modules created dynamically using the [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType "types.ModuleType") constructor; use [`importlib.util.module_from_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.module_from_spec "importlib.util.module_from_spec") instead to ensure the attribute is set to a [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str").
It is **strongly** recommended that you use [`module.__spec__.parent`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent") instead of `module.__package__`. [`__package__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__package__ "module.__package__") is now only used as a fallback if `__spec__.parent` is not set, and this fallback path is deprecated.
Changed in version 3.4: This attribute now defaults to `None` for modules created dynamically using the [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType "types.ModuleType") constructor. Previously the attribute was optional.
Changed in version 3.6: The value of `__package__` is expected to be the same as [`__spec__.parent`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent"). [`__package__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__package__ "module.__package__") is now only used as a fallback during import resolution if `__spec__.parent` is not defined.
Changed in version 3.10: [`ImportWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning") is raised if an import resolution falls back to `__package__` instead of [`__spec__.parent`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent").
Changed in version 3.12: Raise [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") instead of [`ImportWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning") when falling back to `__package__` during import resolution.
Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: `__package__` will cease to be set or taken into consideration by the import system or standard library. 

module.__loader__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__loader__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The [loader](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader) object that the import machinery used to load the module.
This attribute is mostly useful for introspection, but can be used for additional loader-specific functionality, for example getting data associated with a loader.
`__loader__` defaults to `None` for modules created dynamically using the [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType "types.ModuleType") constructor; use [`importlib.util.module_from_spec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.module_from_spec "importlib.util.module_from_spec") instead to ensure the attribute is set to a [loader](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader) object.
It is **strongly** recommended that you use [`module.__spec__.loader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.loader "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.loader") instead of `module.__loader__`.
Changed in version 3.4: This attribute now defaults to `None` for modules created dynamically using the [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType "types.ModuleType") constructor. Previously the attribute was optional.
Deprecated since version 3.12, will be removed in version 3.16: Setting `__loader__` on a module while failing to set `__spec__.loader` is deprecated. In Python 3.16, `__loader__` will cease to be set or taken into consideration by the import system or the standard library. 

module.__path__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__path__ "Link to this definition") 
    
A (possibly empty) [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) of strings enumerating the locations where the package’s submodules will be found. Non-package modules should not have a `__path__` attribute. See [__path__ attributes on modules](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#package-path-rules) for more details.
It is **strongly** recommended that you use [`module.__spec__.submodule_search_locations`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.submodule_search_locations "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.submodule_search_locations") instead of `module.__path__`. 

module.__file__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__file__ "Link to this definition") 


module.__cached__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__cached__ "Link to this definition") 
    
`__file__` and `__cached__` are both optional attributes that may or may not be set. Both attributes should be a [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") when they are available.
`__file__` indicates the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded (if loaded from a file), or the pathname of the shared library file for extension modules loaded dynamically from a shared library. It might be missing for certain types of modules, such as C modules that are statically linked into the interpreter, and the [import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#importsystem) may opt to leave it unset if it has no semantic meaning (for example, a module loaded from a database).
If `__file__` is set then the `__cached__` attribute might also be set, which is the path to any compiled version of the code (for example, a byte-compiled file). The file does not need to exist to set this attribute; the path can simply point to where the compiled file _would_ exist (see [**PEP 3147**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3147/)).
Note that `__cached__` may be set even if `__file__` is not set. However, that scenario is quite atypical. Ultimately, the [loader](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader) is what makes use of the module spec provided by the [finder](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-finder) (from which `__file__` and `__cached__` are derived). So if a loader can load from a cached module but otherwise does not load from a file, that atypical scenario may be appropriate.
It is **strongly** recommended that you use [`module.__spec__.cached`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.cached "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.cached") instead of `module.__cached__`.
Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: Setting `__cached__` on a module while failing to set `__spec__.cached` is deprecated. In Python 3.15, `__cached__` will cease to be set or taken into consideration by the import system or standard library.
####  3.2.9.2. Other writable attributes on module objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#other-writable-attributes-on-module-objects "Link to this heading")
As well as the import-related attributes listed above, module objects also have the following writable attributes: 

module.__doc__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__doc__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The module’s documentation string, or `None` if unavailable. See also: [`__doc__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__doc__ "definition.__doc__"). 

module.__annotations__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__annotations__ "Link to this definition") 
    
A dictionary containing [variable annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-variable-annotation) collected during module body execution. For best practices on working with [`__annotations__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__annotations__ "module.__annotations__"), please see [Annotations Best Practices](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#annotations-howto).
####  3.2.9.3. Module dictionaries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module-dictionaries "Link to this heading")
Module objects also have the following special read-only attribute: 

module.__dict__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__dict__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The module’s namespace as a dictionary object. Uniquely among the attributes listed here, `__dict__` cannot be accessed as a global variable from within a module; it can only be accessed as an attribute on module objects.
**CPython implementation detail:** Because of the way CPython clears module dictionaries, the module dictionary will be cleared when the module falls out of scope even if the dictionary still has live references. To avoid this, copy the dictionary or keep the module around while using its dictionary directly.
###  3.2.10. Custom classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#custom-classes "Link to this heading")
Custom class types are typically created by class definitions (see section [Class definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class)). A class has a namespace implemented by a dictionary object. Class attribute references are translated to lookups in this dictionary, e.g., `C.x` is translated to `C.__dict__["x"]` (although there are a number of hooks which allow for other means of locating attributes). When the attribute name is not found there, the attribute search continues in the base classes. This search of the base classes uses the C3 method resolution order which behaves correctly even in the presence of ‘diamond’ inheritance structures where there are multiple inheritance paths leading back to a common ancestor. Additional details on the C3 MRO used by Python can be found at [The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/mro.html#python-2-3-mro).
When a class attribute reference (for class `C`, say) would yield a class method object, it is transformed into an instance method object whose [`__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__") attribute is `C`. When it would yield a [`staticmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod") object, it is transformed into the object wrapped by the static method object. See section [Implementing Descriptors](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors) for another way in which attributes retrieved from a class may differ from those actually contained in its [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__").
Class attribute assignments update the class’s dictionary, never the dictionary of a base class.
A class object can be called (see above) to yield a class instance (see below).
####  3.2.10.1. Special attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-attributes "Link to this heading")
Attribute | Meaning  
---|--- 

type.__name__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__name__ "Link to this definition") 
| The class’s name. See also: [`__name__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__name__ "definition.__name__"). 

type.__qualname__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__qualname__ "Link to this definition") 
| The class’s [qualified name](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-qualified-name). See also: [`__qualname__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__qualname__ "definition.__qualname__"). 

type.__module__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__module__ "Link to this definition") 
| The name of the module in which the class was defined. 

type.__dict__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__dict__ "Link to this definition") 
| A [`mapping proxy`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.MappingProxyType "types.MappingProxyType") providing a read-only view of the class’s namespace. See also: [`__dict__ attributes`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__"). 

type.__bases__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__bases__ "Link to this definition") 
| A [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing the class’s bases. In most cases, for a class defined as `class X(A, B, C)`, `X.__bases__` will be exactly equal to `(A, B, C)`. 

type.__doc__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__doc__ "Link to this definition") 
| The class’s documentation string, or `None` if undefined. Not inherited by subclasses. 

type.__annotations__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__annotations__ "Link to this definition") 
|  A dictionary containing [variable annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-variable-annotation) collected during class body execution. For best practices on working with `__annotations__`, please see [Annotations Best Practices](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#annotations-howto). Caution Accessing the `__annotations__` attribute of a class object directly may yield incorrect results in the presence of metaclasses. In addition, the attribute may not exist for some classes. Use [`inspect.get_annotations()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.get_annotations "inspect.get_annotations") to retrieve class annotations safely. 

type.__type_params__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__type_params__ "Link to this definition") 
|  A [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing the [type parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) of a [generic class](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes). Added in version 3.12. 

type.__static_attributes__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__static_attributes__ "Link to this definition") 
|  A [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing names of attributes of this class which are assigned through `self.X` from any function in its body. Added in version 3.13. 

type.__firstlineno__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__firstlineno__ "Link to this definition") 
|  The line number of the first line of the class definition, including decorators. Setting the `__module__` attribute removes the `__firstlineno__` item from the type’s dictionary. Added in version 3.13. 

type.__mro__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__mro__ "Link to this definition") 
| The [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") of classes that are considered when looking for base classes during method resolution.  
####  3.2.10.2. Special methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-methods "Link to this heading")
In addition to the special attributes described above, all Python classes also have the following two methods available: 

type.mro()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.mro "Link to this definition") 
    
This method can be overridden by a metaclass to customize the method resolution order for its instances. It is called at class instantiation, and its result is stored in [`__mro__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__mro__ "type.__mro__"). 

type.__subclasses__()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__subclasses__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses. This method returns a list of all those references still alive. The list is in definition order. Example:
Copy```
>>> classA: pass
>>> classB(A): pass
>>> A.__subclasses__()
[<class 'B'>]

```

###  3.2.11. Class instances[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id4 "Link to this heading")
A class instance is created by calling a class object (see above). A class instance has a namespace implemented as a dictionary which is the first place in which attribute references are searched. When an attribute is not found there, and the instance’s class has an attribute by that name, the search continues with the class attributes. If a class attribute is found that is a user-defined function object, it is transformed into an instance method object whose [`__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__") attribute is the instance. Static method and class method objects are also transformed; see above under “Classes”. See section [Implementing Descriptors](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors) for another way in which attributes of a class retrieved via its instances may differ from the objects actually stored in the class’s [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__"). If no class attribute is found, and the object’s class has a [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") method, that is called to satisfy the lookup.
Attribute assignments and deletions update the instance’s dictionary, never a class’s dictionary. If the class has a [`__setattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__ "object.__setattr__") or [`__delattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delattr__ "object.__delattr__") method, this is called instead of updating the instance dictionary directly.
Class instances can pretend to be numbers, sequences, or mappings if they have methods with certain special names. See section [Special method names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames).
####  3.2.11.1. Special attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id5 "Link to this heading") 

object.__class__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The class to which a class instance belongs. 

object.__dict__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "Link to this definition") 
    
A dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object’s (writable) attributes. Not all instances have a `__dict__` attribute; see the section on [__slots__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots) for more details.
###  3.2.12. I/O objects (also known as file objects)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#i-o-objects-also-known-as-file-objects "Link to this heading")
A [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) represents an open file. Various shortcuts are available to create file objects: the [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") built-in function, and also [`os.popen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.popen "os.popen"), [`os.fdopen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fdopen "os.fdopen"), and the [`makefile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.makefile "socket.socket.makefile") method of socket objects (and perhaps by other functions or methods provided by extension modules).
The objects `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are initialized to file objects corresponding to the interpreter’s standard input, output and error streams; they are all open in text mode and therefore follow the interface defined by the [`io.TextIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase "io.TextIOBase") abstract class.
###  3.2.13. Internal types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#internal-types "Link to this heading")
A few types used internally by the interpreter are exposed to the user. Their definitions may change with future versions of the interpreter, but they are mentioned here for completeness.
####  3.2.13.1. Code objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#code-objects "Link to this heading")
Code objects represent _byte-compiled_ executable Python code, or [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode). The difference between a code object and a function object is that the function object contains an explicit reference to the function’s globals (the module in which it was defined), while a code object contains no context; also the default argument values are stored in the function object, not in the code object (because they represent values calculated at run-time). Unlike function objects, code objects are immutable and contain no references (directly or indirectly) to mutable objects.
#####  3.2.13.1.1. Special read-only attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#index-60 "Link to this heading")

codeobject.co_freevars[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_freevars "Link to this definition") 
|  A [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") containing the names of [free (closure) variables](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-closure-variable) that a [nested scope](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-nested-scope) references in an outer scope. See also [`function.__closure__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__closure__ "function.__closure__"). Note: references to global and builtin names are _not_ included.

| The required stack size of the code object 

codeobject.co_flags[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_flags "Link to this definition") 
| An [`integer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") encoding a number of flags for the interpreter.  
The following flag bits are defined for [`co_flags`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_flags "codeobject.co_flags"): bit `0x04` is set if the function uses the `*arguments` syntax to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments; bit `0x08` is set if the function uses the `**keywords` syntax to accept arbitrary keyword arguments; bit `0x20` is set if the function is a generator. See [Code Objects Bit Flags](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect-module-co-flags) for details on the semantics of each flags that might be present.
Future feature declarations (for example, `from __future__ import division`) also use bits in [`co_flags`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_flags "codeobject.co_flags") to indicate whether a code object was compiled with a particular feature enabled. See [`compiler_flag`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#future__._Feature.compiler_flag "__future__._Feature.compiler_flag").
Other bits in [`co_flags`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_flags "codeobject.co_flags") are reserved for internal use.
If a code object represents a function, the first item in [`co_consts`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_consts "codeobject.co_consts") is the documentation string of the function, or `None` if undefined.
#####  3.2.13.1.2. Methods on code objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#methods-on-code-objects "Link to this heading") 

codeobject.co_positions()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_positions "Link to this definition") 
    
Returns an iterable over the source code positions of each [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) instruction in the code object.
The iterator returns [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")s containing the `(start_line, end_line, start_column, end_column)`. The _i-th_ tuple corresponds to the position of the source code that compiled to the _i-th_ code unit. Column information is 0-indexed utf-8 byte offsets on the given source line.
This positional information can be missing. A non-exhaustive lists of cases where this may happen:
  * Running the interpreter with [`-X`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) `no_debug_ranges`.
  * Loading a pyc file compiled while using [`-X`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) `no_debug_ranges`.
  * Position tuples corresponding to artificial instructions.
  * Line and column numbers that can’t be represented due to implementation specific limitations.


When this occurs, some or all of the tuple elements can be [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None").
Added in version 3.11.
Note
This feature requires storing column positions in code objects which may result in a small increase of disk usage of compiled Python files or interpreter memory usage. To avoid storing the extra information and/or deactivate printing the extra traceback information, the [`-X`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) `no_debug_ranges` command line flag or the [`PYTHONNODEBUGRANGES`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONNODEBUGRANGES) environment variable can be used. 

codeobject.co_lines()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lines "Link to this definition") 
    
Returns an iterator that yields information about successive ranges of [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode)s. Each item yielded is a `(start, end, lineno)` [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple"):
  * `start` (an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int")) represents the offset (inclusive) of the start of the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) range
  * `end` (an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int")) represents the offset (exclusive) of the end of the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) range
  * `lineno` is an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") representing the line number of the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) range, or `None` if the bytecodes in the given range have no line number


The items yielded will have the following properties:
  * The first range yielded will have a `start` of 0.
  * The `(start, end)` ranges will be non-decreasing and consecutive. That is, for any pair of [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")s, the `start` of the second will be equal to the `end` of the first.
  * No range will be backwards: `end >= start` for all triples.
  * The last [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") yielded will have `end` equal to the size of the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode).


Zero-width ranges, where `start == end`, are allowed. Zero-width ranges are used for lines that are present in the source code, but have been eliminated by the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) compiler.
Added in version 3.10.

[**PEP 626**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0626/) - Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools.
    
The PEP that introduced the `co_lines()` method. 

codeobject.replace(_** kwargs_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.replace "Link to this definition") 
    
Return a copy of the code object with new values for the specified fields.
Code objects are also supported by the generic function [`copy.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.replace "copy.replace").
Added in version 3.8.
####  3.2.13.2. Frame objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects "Link to this heading")
Frame objects represent execution frames. They may occur in [traceback objects](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback-objects), and are also passed to registered trace functions.
#####  3.2.13.2.1. Special read-only attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#index-66 "Link to this heading") 

frame.f_back[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_back "Link to this definition") 
| Points to the previous stack frame (towards the caller), or `None` if this is the bottom stack frame  
---|--- 

frame.f_code[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_code "Link to this definition") 
| The [code object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#code-objects) being executed in this frame. Accessing this attribute raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `object.__getattr__` with arguments `obj` and `"f_code"`. 

frame.f_locals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_locals "Link to this definition") 
|  The mapping used by the frame to look up [local variables](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming). If the frame refers to an [optimized scope](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope), this may return a write-through proxy object. Changed in version 3.13: Return a proxy for optimized scopes. 

frame.f_globals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_globals "Link to this definition") 
| The dictionary used by the frame to look up [global variables](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming) 

frame.f_builtins[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_builtins "Link to this definition") 
| The dictionary used by the frame to look up [built-in (intrinsic) names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming) 

frame.f_lasti[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_lasti "Link to this definition") 
| The “precise instruction” of the frame object (this is an index into the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) string of the [code object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#code-objects))  
#####  3.2.13.2.2. Special writable attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#index-67 "Link to this heading") 

frame.f_trace[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_trace "Link to this definition") 
| If not `None`, this is a function called for various events during code execution (this is used by debuggers). Normally an event is triggered for each new source line (see [`f_trace_lines`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_trace_lines "frame.f_trace_lines")).  
---|--- 

frame.f_trace_lines[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_trace_lines "Link to this definition") 
| Set this attribute to [`False`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False "False") to disable triggering a tracing event for each source line. 

frame.f_trace_opcodes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_trace_opcodes "Link to this definition") 
| Set this attribute to [`True`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True "True") to allow per-opcode events to be requested. Note that this may lead to undefined interpreter behaviour if exceptions raised by the trace function escape to the function being traced. 

frame.f_lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_lineno "Link to this definition") 
| The current line number of the frame – writing to this from within a trace function jumps to the given line (only for the bottom-most frame). A debugger can implement a Jump command (aka Set Next Statement) by writing to this attribute.  
#####  3.2.13.2.3. Frame object methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-object-methods "Link to this heading")
Frame objects support one method: 

frame.clear()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame.clear "Link to this definition") 
    
This method clears all references to [local variables](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming) held by the frame. Also, if the frame belonged to a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator), the generator is finalized. This helps break reference cycles involving frame objects (for example when catching an [exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions) and storing its [traceback](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback-objects) for later use).
[`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised if the frame is currently executing or suspended.
Added in version 3.4.
Changed in version 3.13: Attempting to clear a suspended frame raises [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") (as has always been the case for executing frames).
####  3.2.13.3. Traceback objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback-objects "Link to this heading")
Traceback objects represent the stack trace of an [exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#tut-errors). A traceback object is implicitly created when an exception occurs, and may also be explicitly created by calling [`types.TracebackType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.TracebackType "types.TracebackType").
Changed in version 3.7: Traceback objects can now be explicitly instantiated from Python code.
For implicitly created tracebacks, when the search for an exception handler unwinds the execution stack, at each unwound level a traceback object is inserted in front of the current traceback. When an exception handler is entered, the stack trace is made available to the program. (See section [The try statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try).) It is accessible as the third item of the tuple returned by [`sys.exc_info()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info"), and as the [`__traceback__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__traceback__ "BaseException.__traceback__") attribute of the caught exception.
When the program contains no suitable handler, the stack trace is written (nicely formatted) to the standard error stream; if the interpreter is interactive, it is also made available to the user as [`sys.last_traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.last_traceback "sys.last_traceback").
For explicitly created tracebacks, it is up to the creator of the traceback to determine how the [`tb_next`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_next "traceback.tb_next") attributes should be linked to form a full stack trace.
Special read-only attributes: 

traceback.tb_frame[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_frame "Link to this definition") 
|  Points to the execution [frame](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) of the current level. Accessing this attribute raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `object.__getattr__` with arguments `obj` and `"tb_frame"`.  
---|--- 

traceback.tb_lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_lineno "Link to this definition") 
| Gives the line number where the exception occurred 

traceback.tb_lasti[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_lasti "Link to this definition") 
| Indicates the “precise instruction”.  
The line number and last instruction in the traceback may differ from the line number of its [frame object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) if the exception occurred in a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement with no matching except clause or with a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause. 

traceback.tb_next[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_next "Link to this definition") 
    
The special writable attribute `tb_next` is the next level in the stack trace (towards the frame where the exception occurred), or `None` if there is no next level.
Changed in version 3.7: This attribute is now writable
####  3.2.13.4. Slice objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slice-objects "Link to this heading")
Slice objects are used to represent slices for [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") methods. They are also created by the built-in [`slice()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice "slice") function.
Special read-only attributes: [`start`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.start "slice.start") is the lower bound; [`stop`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.stop "slice.stop") is the upper bound; [`step`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.step "slice.step") is the step value; each is `None` if omitted. These attributes can have any type.
Slice objects support one method: 

slice.indices(_self_ , _length_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slice.indices "Link to this definition") 
    
This method takes a single integer argument _length_ and computes information about the slice that the slice object would describe if applied to a sequence of _length_ items. It returns a tuple of three integers; respectively these are the _start_ and _stop_ indices and the _step_ or stride length of the slice. Missing or out-of-bounds indices are handled in a manner consistent with regular slices.
####  3.2.13.5. Static method objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#static-method-objects "Link to this heading")
Static method objects provide a way of defeating the transformation of function objects to method objects described above. A static method object is a wrapper around any other object, usually a user-defined method object. When a static method object is retrieved from a class or a class instance, the object actually returned is the wrapped object, which is not subject to any further transformation. Static method objects are also callable. Static method objects are created by the built-in [`staticmethod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod") constructor.
####  3.2.13.6. Class method objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#class-method-objects "Link to this heading")
A class method object, like a static method object, is a wrapper around another object that alters the way in which that object is retrieved from classes and class instances. The behaviour of class method objects upon such retrieval is described above, under [“instance methods”](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#instance-methods). Class method objects are created by the built-in [`classmethod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod") constructor.
##  3.3. Special method names[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names "Link to this heading")
A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax (such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods with special names. This is Python’s approach to _operator overloading_ , allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to language operators. For instance, if a class defines a method named [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"), and `x` is an instance of this class, then `x[i]` is roughly equivalent to `type(x).__getitem__(x, i)`. Except where mentioned, attempts to execute an operation raise an exception when no appropriate method is defined (typically [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") or [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError")).
Setting a special method to `None` indicates that the corresponding operation is not available. For example, if a class sets [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__ "object.__iter__") to `None`, the class is not iterable, so calling [`iter()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter "iter") on its instances will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") (without falling back to [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__")). [[2]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id20)
When implementing a class that emulates any built-in type, it is important that the emulation only be implemented to the degree that it makes sense for the object being modelled. For example, some sequences may work well with retrieval of individual elements, but extracting a slice may not make sense. (One example of this is the `NodeList` interface in the W3C’s Document Object Model.)
###  3.3.1. Basic customization[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization "Link to this heading") 

object.__new__(_cls_[, _..._])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to create a new instance of class _cls_. [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") is a static method (special-cased so you need not declare it as such) that takes the class of which an instance was requested as its first argument. The remaining arguments are those passed to the object constructor expression (the call to the class). The return value of [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") should be the new object instance (usually an instance of _cls_).
Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by invoking the superclass’s [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") method using `super().__new__(cls[, ...])` with appropriate arguments and then modifying the newly created instance as necessary before returning it.
If [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") is invoked during object construction and it returns an instance of _cls_ , then the new instance’s [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method will be invoked like `__init__(self[, ...])`, where _self_ is the new instance and the remaining arguments are the same as were passed to the object constructor.
If [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") does not return an instance of _cls_ , then the new instance’s [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method will not be invoked.
[`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") is intended mainly to allow subclasses of immutable types (like int, str, or tuple) to customize instance creation. It is also commonly overridden in custom metaclasses in order to customize class creation. 

object.__init__(_self_[, _..._])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called after the instance has been created (by [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__")), but before it is returned to the caller. The arguments are those passed to the class constructor expression. If a base class has an [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method, the derived class’s [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method, if any, must explicitly call it to ensure proper initialization of the base class part of the instance; for example: `super().__init__([args...])`.
Because [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") and [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") work together in constructing objects ([`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__") to create it, and [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") to customize it), no non-`None` value may be returned by [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__"); doing so will cause a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") to be raised at runtime. 

object.__del__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when the instance is about to be destroyed. This is also called a finalizer or (improperly) a destructor. If a base class has a [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") method, the derived class’s [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") method, if any, must explicitly call it to ensure proper deletion of the base class part of the instance.
It is possible (though not recommended!) for the [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") method to postpone destruction of the instance by creating a new reference to it. This is called object _resurrection_. It is implementation-dependent whether [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") is called a second time when a resurrected object is about to be destroyed; the current [CPython](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-CPython) implementation only calls it once.
It is not guaranteed that [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") methods are called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exits. [`weakref.finalize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.finalize "weakref.finalize") provides a straightforward way to register a cleanup function to be called when an object is garbage collected.
Note
`del x` doesn’t directly call `x.__del__()` — the former decrements the reference count for `x` by one, and the latter is only called when `x`’s reference count reaches zero.
**CPython implementation detail:** It is possible for a reference cycle to prevent the reference count of an object from going to zero. In this case, the cycle will be later detected and deleted by the [cyclic garbage collector](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-garbage-collection). A common cause of reference cycles is when an exception has been caught in a local variable. The frame’s locals then reference the exception, which references its own traceback, which references the locals of all frames caught in the traceback.
See also
Documentation for the [`gc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#module-gc "gc: Interface to the cycle-detecting garbage collector.") module.
Warning
Due to the precarious circumstances under which [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") methods are invoked, exceptions that occur during their execution are ignored, and a warning is printed to `sys.stderr` instead. In particular:
  * [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") can be invoked when arbitrary code is being executed, including from any arbitrary thread. If [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") needs to take a lock or invoke any other blocking resource, it may deadlock as the resource may already be taken by the code that gets interrupted to execute [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__").
  * [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") can be executed during interpreter shutdown. As a consequence, the global variables it needs to access (including other modules) may already have been deleted or set to `None`. Python guarantees that globals whose name begins with a single underscore are deleted from their module before other globals are deleted; if no other references to such globals exist, this may help in assuring that imported modules are still available at the time when the [`__del__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") method is called.



object.__repr__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called by the [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not possible, a string of the form `<...some useful description...>` should be returned. The return value must be a string object. If a class defines [`__repr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "object.__repr__") but not [`__str__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "object.__str__"), then [`__repr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "object.__repr__") is also used when an “informal” string representation of instances of that class is required.
This is typically used for debugging, so it is important that the representation is information-rich and unambiguous. A default implementation is provided by the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself. 

object.__str__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called by [`str(object)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str"), the default [`__format__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__format__ "object.__format__") implementation, and the built-in function [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print"), to compute the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. The return value must be a [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq) object.
This method differs from [`object.__repr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "object.__repr__") in that there is no expectation that [`__str__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "object.__str__") return a valid Python expression: a more convenient or concise representation can be used.
The default implementation defined by the built-in type [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") calls [`object.__repr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "object.__repr__"). 

object.__bytes__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bytes__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called by [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-bytes) to compute a byte-string representation of an object. This should return a [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object. The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not provide this method. 

object.__format__(_self_ , _format_spec_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__format__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called by the [`format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format "format") built-in function, and by extension, evaluation of [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) and the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method, to produce a “formatted” string representation of an object. The _format_spec_ argument is a string that contains a description of the formatting options desired. The interpretation of the _format_spec_ argument is up to the type implementing [`__format__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__format__ "object.__format__"), however most classes will either delegate formatting to one of the built-in types, or use a similar formatting option syntax.
See [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) for a description of the standard formatting syntax.
The return value must be a string object.
The default implementation by the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class should be given an empty _format_spec_ string. It delegates to [`__str__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "object.__str__").
Changed in version 3.4: The __format__ method of `object` itself raises a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if passed any non-empty string.
Changed in version 3.7: `object.__format__(x, '')` is now equivalent to `str(x)` rather than `format(str(x), '')`. 

object.__lt__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__le__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__le__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__eq__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ne__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ne__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__gt__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__gt__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ge__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ge__ "Link to this definition") 
    
These are the so-called “rich comparison” methods. The correspondence between operator symbols and method names is as follows: `x<y` calls `x.__lt__(y)`, `x<=y` calls `x.__le__(y)`, `x==y` calls `x.__eq__(y)`, `x!=y` calls `x.__ne__(y)`, `x>y` calls `x.__gt__(y)`, and `x>=y` calls `x.__ge__(y)`.
A rich comparison method may return the singleton [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") if it does not implement the operation for a given pair of arguments. By convention, `False` and `True` are returned for a successful comparison. However, these methods can return any value, so if the comparison operator is used in a Boolean context (e.g., in the condition of an `if` statement), Python will call [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "bool") on the value to determine if the result is true or false.
By default, `object` implements [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") by using `is`, returning [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") in the case of a false comparison: `True if x is y else NotImplemented`. For [`__ne__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ne__ "object.__ne__"), by default it delegates to [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") and inverts the result unless it is `NotImplemented`. There are no other implied relationships among the comparison operators or default implementations; for example, the truth of `(x<y or x==y)` does not imply `x<=y`. To automatically generate ordering operations from a single root operation, see [`functools.total_ordering()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering "functools.total_ordering").
By default, the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class provides implementations consistent with [Value comparisons](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expressions-value-comparisons): equality compares according to object identity, and order comparisons raise [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). Each default method may generate these results directly, but may also return [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented").
See the paragraph on [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") for some important notes on creating [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable) objects which support custom comparison operations and are usable as dictionary keys.
There are no swapped-argument versions of these methods (to be used when the left argument does not support the operation but the right argument does); rather, [`__lt__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__ "object.__lt__") and [`__gt__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__gt__ "object.__gt__") are each other’s reflection, [`__le__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__le__ "object.__le__") and [`__ge__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ge__ "object.__ge__") are each other’s reflection, and [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") and [`__ne__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ne__ "object.__ne__") are their own reflection. If the operands are of different types, and the right operand’s type is a direct or indirect subclass of the left operand’s type, the reflected method of the right operand has priority, otherwise the left operand’s method has priority. Virtual subclassing is not considered.
When no appropriate method returns any value other than [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented"), the `==` and `!=` operators will fall back to `is` and `is not`, respectively. 

object.__hash__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called by built-in function [`hash()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash "hash") and for operations on members of hashed collections including [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set"), [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset"), and [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict"). The `__hash__()` method should return an integer. The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash value; it is advised to mix together the hash values of the components of the object that also play a part in comparison of objects by packing them into a tuple and hashing the tuple. Example:
Copy```
def__hash__(self):
    return hash((self.name, self.nick, self.color))

```

Note
[`hash()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash "hash") truncates the value returned from an object’s custom [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") method to the size of a [`Py_ssize_t`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#c.Py_ssize_t "Py_ssize_t"). This is typically 8 bytes on 64-bit builds and 4 bytes on 32-bit builds. If an object’s [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") must interoperate on builds of different bit sizes, be sure to check the width on all supported builds. An easy way to do this is with `python -c "import sys; print(sys.hash_info.width)"`.
If a class does not define an [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") method it should not define a [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") operation either; if it defines [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") but not [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__"), its instances will not be usable as items in hashable collections. If a class defines mutable objects and implements an [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") method, it should not implement [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__"), since the implementation of [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable) collections requires that a key’s hash value is immutable (if the object’s hash value changes, it will be in the wrong hash bucket).
User-defined classes have [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") and [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") methods by default (inherited from the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class); with them, all objects compare unequal (except with themselves) and `x.__hash__()` returns an appropriate value such that `x == y` implies both that `x is y` and `hash(x) == hash(y)`.
A class that overrides [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") and does not define [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") will have its [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") implicitly set to `None`. When the [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") method of a class is `None`, instances of the class will raise an appropriate [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") when a program attempts to retrieve their hash value, and will also be correctly identified as unhashable when checking `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Hashable)`.
If a class that overrides [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") needs to retain the implementation of [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") from a parent class, the interpreter must be told this explicitly by setting `__hash__ = <ParentClass>.__hash__`.
If a class that does not override [`__eq__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__ "object.__eq__") wishes to suppress hash support, it should include `__hash__ = None` in the class definition. A class which defines its own [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") that explicitly raises a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") would be incorrectly identified as hashable by an `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Hashable)` call.
Note
By default, the [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") values of str and bytes objects are “salted” with an unpredictable random value. Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python.
This is intended to provide protection against a denial-of-service caused by carefully chosen inputs that exploit the worst case performance of a dict insertion, _O_(_n_ 2) complexity. See <http://ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html> for details.
Changing hash values affects the iteration order of sets. Python has never made guarantees about this ordering (and it typically varies between 32-bit and 64-bit builds).
See also [`PYTHONHASHSEED`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED).
Changed in version 3.3: Hash randomization is enabled by default. 

object.__bool__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation `bool()`; should return `False` or `True`. When this method is not defined, [`__len__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__ "object.__len__") is called, if it is defined, and the object is considered true if its result is nonzero. If a class defines neither `__len__()` nor `__bool__()` (which is true of the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself), all its instances are considered true.
###  3.3.2. Customizing attribute access[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-attribute-access "Link to this heading")
The following methods can be defined to customize the meaning of attribute access (use of, assignment to, or deletion of `x.name`) for class instances. 

object.__getattr__(_self_ , _name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when the default attribute access fails with an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") (either [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") raises an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") because _name_ is not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree for `self`; or [`__get__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__get__ "object.__get__") of a _name_ property raises [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError")). This method should either return the (computed) attribute value or raise an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") exception. The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not provide this method.
Note that if the attribute is found through the normal mechanism, [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") is not called. (This is an intentional asymmetry between [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") and [`__setattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__ "object.__setattr__").) This is done both for efficiency reasons and because otherwise [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") would have no way to access other attributes of the instance. Note that at least for instance variables, you can take total control by not inserting any values in the instance attribute dictionary (but instead inserting them in another object). See the [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") method below for a way to actually get total control over attribute access. 

object.__getattribute__(_self_ , _name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the class. If the class also defines [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__"), the latter will not be called unless [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") either calls it explicitly or raises an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"). This method should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") exception. In order to avoid infinite recursion in this method, its implementation should always call the base class method with the same name to access any attributes it needs, for example, `object.__getattribute__(self, name)`.
Note
This method may still be bypassed when looking up special methods as the result of implicit invocation via language syntax or [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#builtin-functions). See [Special method lookup](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-lookup).
For certain sensitive attribute accesses, raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `object.__getattr__` with arguments `obj` and `name`. 

object.__setattr__(_self_ , _name_ , _value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when an attribute assignment is attempted. This is called instead of the normal mechanism (i.e. store the value in the instance dictionary). _name_ is the attribute name, _value_ is the value to be assigned to it.
If [`__setattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__ "object.__setattr__") wants to assign to an instance attribute, it should call the base class method with the same name, for example, `object.__setattr__(self, name, value)`.
For certain sensitive attribute assignments, raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `object.__setattr__` with arguments `obj`, `name`, `value`. 

object.__delattr__(_self_ , _name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delattr__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Like [`__setattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__ "object.__setattr__") but for attribute deletion instead of assignment. This should only be implemented if `del obj.name` is meaningful for the object.
For certain sensitive attribute deletions, raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `object.__delattr__` with arguments `obj` and `name`. 

object.__dir__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dir__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") is called on the object. An iterable must be returned. [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") converts the returned iterable to a list and sorts it.
####  3.3.2.1. Customizing module attribute access[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-module-attribute-access "Link to this heading") 

module.__getattr__()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__getattr__ "Link to this definition") 


module.__dir__()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__dir__ "Link to this definition") 

Special names `__getattr__` and `__dir__` can be also used to customize access to module attributes. The `__getattr__` function at the module level should accept one argument which is the name of an attribute and return the computed value or raise an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"). If an attribute is not found on a module object through the normal lookup, i.e. [`object.__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__"), then `__getattr__` is searched in the module `__dict__` before raising an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"). If found, it is called with the attribute name and the result is returned.
The `__dir__` function should accept no arguments, and return an iterable of strings that represents the names accessible on module. If present, this function overrides the standard [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") search on a module. 

module.__class__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__class__ "Link to this definition") 

For a more fine grained customization of the module behavior (setting attributes, properties, etc.), one can set the `__class__` attribute of a module object to a subclass of [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType "types.ModuleType"). For example:
Copy```
importsys
fromtypesimport ModuleType

classVerboseModule(ModuleType):
    def__repr__(self):
        return f'Verbose {self.__name__}'

    def__setattr__(self, attr, value):
        print(f'Setting {attr}...')
        super().__setattr__(attr, value)

sys.modules[__name__].__class__ = VerboseModule

```

Note
Defining module `__getattr__` and setting module `__class__` only affect lookups made using the attribute access syntax – directly accessing the module globals (whether by code within the module, or via a reference to the module’s globals dictionary) is unaffected.
Changed in version 3.5: `__class__` module attribute is now writable.
Added in version 3.7: `__getattr__` and `__dir__` module attributes.
See also 

[**PEP 562**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0562/) - Module __getattr__ and __dir__
    
Describes the `__getattr__` and `__dir__` functions on modules.
####  3.3.2.2. Implementing Descriptors[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#implementing-descriptors "Link to this heading")
The following methods only apply when an instance of the class containing the method (a so-called _descriptor_ class) appears in an _owner_ class (the descriptor must be in either the owner’s class dictionary or in the class dictionary for one of its parents). In the examples below, “the attribute” refers to the attribute whose name is the key of the property in the owner class’ [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__"). The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not implement any of these protocols. 

object.__get__(_self_ , _instance_ , _owner =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__get__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to get the attribute of the owner class (class attribute access) or of an instance of that class (instance attribute access). The optional _owner_ argument is the owner class, while _instance_ is the instance that the attribute was accessed through, or `None` when the attribute is accessed through the _owner_.
This method should return the computed attribute value or raise an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") exception.
[**PEP 252**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0252/) specifies that [`__get__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__get__ "object.__get__") is callable with one or two arguments. Python’s own built-in descriptors support this specification; however, it is likely that some third-party tools have descriptors that require both arguments. Python’s own [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") implementation always passes in both arguments whether they are required or not. 

object.__set__(_self_ , _instance_ , _value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to set the attribute on an instance _instance_ of the owner class to a new value, _value_.
Note, adding [`__set__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set__ "object.__set__") or [`__delete__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delete__ "object.__delete__") changes the kind of descriptor to a “data descriptor”. See [Invoking Descriptors](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptor-invocation) for more details. 

object.__delete__(_self_ , _instance_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delete__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to delete the attribute on an instance _instance_ of the owner class.
Instances of descriptors may also have the `__objclass__` attribute present: 

object.__objclass__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__objclass__ "Link to this definition") 
    
The attribute `__objclass__` is interpreted by the [`inspect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#module-inspect "inspect: Extract information and source code from live objects.") module as specifying the class where this object was defined (setting this appropriately can assist in runtime introspection of dynamic class attributes). For callables, it may indicate that an instance of the given type (or a subclass) is expected or required as the first positional argument (for example, CPython sets this attribute for unbound methods that are implemented in C).
####  3.3.2.3. Invoking Descriptors[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#invoking-descriptors "Link to this heading")
In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with “binding behavior”, one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol: [`__get__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__get__ "object.__get__"), [`__set__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set__ "object.__set__"), and [`__delete__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delete__ "object.__delete__"). If any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a descriptor.
The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the attribute from an object’s dictionary. For instance, `a.x` has a lookup chain starting with `a.__dict__['x']`, then `type(a).__dict__['x']`, and continuing through the base classes of `type(a)` excluding metaclasses.
However, if the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined and how they were called.
The starting point for descriptor invocation is a binding, `a.x`. How the arguments are assembled depends on `a`: 

Direct Call
    
The simplest and least common call is when user code directly invokes a descriptor method: `x.__get__(a)`. 

Instance Binding
    
If binding to an object instance, `a.x` is transformed into the call: `type(a).__dict__['x'].__get__(a, type(a))`. 

Class Binding
    
If binding to a class, `A.x` is transformed into the call: `A.__dict__['x'].__get__(None, A)`. 

Super Binding
    
A dotted lookup such as `super(A, a).x` searches `a.__class__.__mro__` for a base class `B` following `A` and then returns `B.__dict__['x'].__get__(a, A)`. If not a descriptor, `x` is returned unchanged.
For instance bindings, the precedence of descriptor invocation depends on which descriptor methods are defined. A descriptor can define any combination of [`__get__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__get__ "object.__get__"), [`__set__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set__ "object.__set__") and [`__delete__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delete__ "object.__delete__"). If it does not define `__get__()`, then accessing the attribute will return the descriptor object itself unless there is a value in the object’s instance dictionary. If the descriptor defines `__set__()` and/or `__delete__()`, it is a data descriptor; if it defines neither, it is a non-data descriptor. Normally, data descriptors define both `__get__()` and `__set__()`, while non-data descriptors have just the `__get__()` method. Data descriptors with `__get__()` and `__set__()` (and/or `__delete__()`) defined always override a redefinition in an instance dictionary. In contrast, non-data descriptors can be overridden by instances.
Python methods (including those decorated with [`@staticmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod") and [`@classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod")) are implemented as non-data descriptors. Accordingly, instances can redefine and override methods. This allows individual instances to acquire behaviors that differ from other instances of the same class.
The [`property()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property "property") function is implemented as a data descriptor. Accordingly, instances cannot override the behavior of a property.
####  3.3.2.4. __slots__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots "Link to this heading")
___slots___ allow us to explicitly declare data members (like properties) and deny the creation of [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") and ___weakref___ (unless explicitly declared in ___slots___ or available in a parent.)
The space saved over using [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") can be significant. Attribute lookup speed can be significantly improved as well. 

object.__slots__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__slots__ "Link to this definition") 
    
This class variable can be assigned a string, iterable, or sequence of strings with variable names used by instances. ___slots___ reserves space for the declared variables and prevents the automatic creation of [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") and ___weakref___ for each instance.
Notes on using ___slots___ :
  * When inheriting from a class without ___slots___ , the [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") and ___weakref___ attribute of the instances will always be accessible.
  * Without a [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") variable, instances cannot be assigned new variables not listed in the ___slots___ definition. Attempts to assign to an unlisted variable name raises [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"). If dynamic assignment of new variables is desired, then add `'__dict__'` to the sequence of strings in the ___slots___ declaration.
  * Without a ___weakref___ variable for each instance, classes defining ___slots___ do not support [`weak references`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#module-weakref "weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries.") to its instances. If weak reference support is needed, then add `'__weakref__'` to the sequence of strings in the ___slots___ declaration.
  * ___slots___ are implemented at the class level by creating [descriptors](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors) for each variable name. As a result, class attributes cannot be used to set default values for instance variables defined by ___slots___ ; otherwise, the class attribute would overwrite the descriptor assignment.
  * The action of a ___slots___ declaration is not limited to the class where it is defined. ___slots___ declared in parents are available in child classes. However, instances of a child subclass will get a [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") and ___weakref___ unless the subclass also defines ___slots___ (which should only contain names of any _additional_ slots).
  * If a class defines a slot also defined in a base class, the instance variable defined by the base class slot is inaccessible (except by retrieving its descriptor directly from the base class). This renders the meaning of the program undefined. In the future, a check may be added to prevent this.
  * [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") will be raised if nonempty ___slots___ are defined for a class derived from a [`"variable-length" built-in type`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_itemsize "PyTypeObject.tp_itemsize") such as [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"), [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"), and [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple").
  * Any non-string [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) may be assigned to ___slots___.
  * If a [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") is used to assign ___slots___ , the dictionary keys will be used as the slot names. The values of the dictionary can be used to provide per-attribute docstrings that will be recognised by [`inspect.getdoc()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.getdoc "inspect.getdoc") and displayed in the output of [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help "help").
  * [`__class__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class__ "object.__class__") assignment works only if both classes have the same ___slots___.
  * [Multiple inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-multiple) with multiple slotted parent classes can be used, but only one parent is allowed to have attributes created by slots (the other bases must have empty slot layouts) - violations raise [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
  * If an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator) is used for ___slots___ then a [descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-descriptor) is created for each of the iterator’s values. However, the ___slots___ attribute will be an empty iterator.


###  3.3.3. Customizing class creation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-class-creation "Link to this heading")
Whenever a class inherits from another class, [`__init_subclass__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init_subclass__ "object.__init_subclass__") is called on the parent class. This way, it is possible to write classes which change the behavior of subclasses. This is closely related to class decorators, but where class decorators only affect the specific class they’re applied to, `__init_subclass__` solely applies to future subclasses of the class defining the method. 

_classmethod_ object.__init_subclass__(_cls_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init_subclass__ "Link to this definition") 
    
This method is called whenever the containing class is subclassed. _cls_ is then the new subclass. If defined as a normal instance method, this method is implicitly converted to a class method.
Keyword arguments which are given to a new class are passed to the parent class’s `__init_subclass__`. For compatibility with other classes using `__init_subclass__`, one should take out the needed keyword arguments and pass the others over to the base class, as in:
Copy```
classPhilosopher:
    def__init_subclass__(cls, /, default_name, **kwargs):
        super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
        cls.default_name = default_name

classAustralianPhilosopher(Philosopher, default_name="Bruce"):
    pass

```

The default implementation `object.__init_subclass__` does nothing, but raises an error if it is called with any arguments.
Note
The metaclass hint `metaclass` is consumed by the rest of the type machinery, and is never passed to `__init_subclass__` implementations. The actual metaclass (rather than the explicit hint) can be accessed as `type(cls)`.
Added in version 3.6.
When a class is created, `type.__new__()` scans the class variables and makes callbacks to those with a [`__set_name__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__ "object.__set_name__") hook. 

object.__set_name__(_self_ , _owner_ , _name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Automatically called at the time the owning class _owner_ is created. The object has been assigned to _name_ in that class:
Copy```
classA:
    x = C()  # Automatically calls: x.__set_name__(A, 'x')

```

If the class variable is assigned after the class is created, [`__set_name__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__ "object.__set_name__") will not be called automatically. If needed, [`__set_name__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__ "object.__set_name__") can be called directly:
Copy```
classA:
   pass

c = C()
A.x = c                  # The hook is not called
c.__set_name__(A, 'x')   # Manually invoke the hook

```

See [Creating the class object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#class-object-creation) for more details.
Added in version 3.6.
####  3.3.3.1. Metaclasses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses "Link to this heading")
By default, classes are constructed using [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type"). The class body is executed in a new namespace and the class name is bound locally to the result of `type(name, bases, namespace)`.
The class creation process can be customized by passing the `metaclass` keyword argument in the class definition line, or by inheriting from an existing class that included such an argument. In the following example, both `MyClass` and `MySubclass` are instances of `Meta`:
Copy```
classMeta(type):
    pass

classMyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

classMySubclass(MyClass):
    pass

```

Any other keyword arguments that are specified in the class definition are passed through to all metaclass operations described below.
When a class definition is executed, the following steps occur:
  * MRO entries are resolved;
  * the appropriate metaclass is determined;
  * the class namespace is prepared;
  * the class body is executed;
  * the class object is created.


####  3.3.3.2. Resolving MRO entries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#resolving-mro-entries "Link to this heading") 

object.__mro_entries__(_self_ , _bases_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mro_entries__ "Link to this definition") 
    
If a base that appears in a class definition is not an instance of [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type"), then an `__mro_entries__()` method is searched on the base. If an `__mro_entries__()` method is found, the base is substituted with the result of a call to `__mro_entries__()` when creating the class. The method is called with the original bases tuple passed to the _bases_ parameter, and must return a tuple of classes that will be used instead of the base. The returned tuple may be empty: in these cases, the original base is ignored.

Core support for typing module and generic types.
####  3.3.3.3. Determining the appropriate metaclass[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#determining-the-appropriate-metaclass "Link to this heading")
The appropriate metaclass for a class definition is determined as follows:
  * if no bases and no explicit metaclass are given, then [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") is used;
  * if an explicit metaclass is given and it is _not_ an instance of [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type"), then it is used directly as the metaclass;
  * if an instance of [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") is given as the explicit metaclass, or bases are defined, then the most derived metaclass is used.


The most derived metaclass is selected from the explicitly specified metaclass (if any) and the metaclasses (i.e. `type(cls)`) of all specified base classes. The most derived metaclass is one which is a subtype of _all_ of these candidate metaclasses. If none of the candidate metaclasses meets that criterion, then the class definition will fail with `TypeError`.
####  3.3.3.4. Preparing the class namespace[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#preparing-the-class-namespace "Link to this heading")
Once the appropriate metaclass has been identified, then the class namespace is prepared. If the metaclass has a `__prepare__` attribute, it is called as `namespace = metaclass.__prepare__(name, bases, **kwds)` (where the additional keyword arguments, if any, come from the class definition). The `__prepare__` method should be implemented as a [`classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod"). The namespace returned by `__prepare__` is passed in to `__new__`, but when the final class object is created the namespace is copied into a new `dict`.
If the metaclass has no `__prepare__` attribute, then the class namespace is initialised as an empty ordered mapping.

Introduced the `__prepare__` namespace hook
####  3.3.3.5. Executing the class body[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#executing-the-class-body "Link to this heading")
The class body is executed (approximately) as `exec(body, globals(), namespace)`. The key difference from a normal call to [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") is that lexical scoping allows the class body (including any methods) to reference names from the current and outer scopes when the class definition occurs inside a function.
However, even when the class definition occurs inside the function, methods defined inside the class still cannot see names defined at the class scope. Class variables must be accessed through the first parameter of instance or class methods, or through the implicit lexically scoped `__class__` reference described in the next section.
####  3.3.3.6. Creating the class object[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#creating-the-class-object "Link to this heading")
Once the class namespace has been populated by executing the class body, the class object is created by calling `metaclass(name, bases, namespace, **kwds)` (the additional keywords passed here are the same as those passed to `__prepare__`).
This class object is the one that will be referenced by the zero-argument form of [`super()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super "super"). `__class__` is an implicit closure reference created by the compiler if any methods in a class body refer to either `__class__` or `super`. This allows the zero argument form of [`super()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super "super") to correctly identify the class being defined based on lexical scoping, while the class or instance that was used to make the current call is identified based on the first argument passed to the method.
**CPython implementation detail:** In CPython 3.6 and later, the `__class__` cell is passed to the metaclass as a `__classcell__` entry in the class namespace. If present, this must be propagated up to the `type.__new__` call in order for the class to be initialised correctly. Failing to do so will result in a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") in Python 3.8.
When using the default metaclass [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type"), or any metaclass that ultimately calls `type.__new__`, the following additional customization steps are invoked after creating the class object:
  1. The `type.__new__` method collects all of the attributes in the class namespace that define a [`__set_name__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__ "object.__set_name__") method;
  2. Those `__set_name__` methods are called with the class being defined and the assigned name of that particular attribute;
  3. The [`__init_subclass__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init_subclass__ "object.__init_subclass__") hook is called on the immediate parent of the new class in its method resolution order.


After the class object is created, it is passed to the class decorators included in the class definition (if any) and the resulting object is bound in the local namespace as the defined class.
When a new class is created by `type.__new__`, the object provided as the namespace parameter is copied to a new ordered mapping and the original object is discarded. The new copy is wrapped in a read-only proxy, which becomes the [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__dict__ "type.__dict__") attribute of the class object.

####  3.3.3.7. Uses for metaclasses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#uses-for-metaclasses "Link to this heading")
The potential uses for metaclasses are boundless. Some ideas that have been explored include enum, logging, interface checking, automatic delegation, automatic property creation, proxies, frameworks, and automatic resource locking/synchronization.
###  3.3.4. Customizing instance and subclass checks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-instance-and-subclass-checks "Link to this heading")
The following methods are used to override the default behavior of the [`isinstance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") and [`issubclass()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#issubclass "issubclass") built-in functions.
In particular, the metaclass [`abc.ABCMeta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.ABCMeta "abc.ABCMeta") implements these methods in order to allow the addition of Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) as “virtual base classes” to any class or type (including built-in types), including other ABCs. 

type.__instancecheck__(_self_ , _instance_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__instancecheck__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Return true if _instance_ should be considered a (direct or indirect) instance of _class_. If defined, called to implement `isinstance(instance, class)`. 

type.__subclasscheck__(_self_ , _subclass_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__subclasscheck__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Return true if _subclass_ should be considered a (direct or indirect) subclass of _class_. If defined, called to implement `issubclass(subclass, class)`.
Note that these methods are looked up on the type (metaclass) of a class. They cannot be defined as class methods in the actual class. This is consistent with the lookup of special methods that are called on instances, only in this case the instance is itself a class.

###  3.3.5. Emulating generic types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-generic-types "Link to this heading")
When using [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-annotation), it is often useful to _parameterize_ a [generic type](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generic-type) using Python’s square-brackets notation. For example, the annotation `list[int]` might be used to signify a [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") in which all the elements are of type [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int").

Documentation on how to implement generic classes that can be parameterized at runtime and understood by static type-checkers.
A class can _generally_ only be parameterized if it defines the special class method `__class_getitem__()`.

Return an object representing the specialization of a generic class by type arguments found in _key_.
When defined on a class, `__class_getitem__()` is automatically a class method. As such, there is no need for it to be decorated with [`@classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod") when it is defined.
####  3.3.5.1. The purpose of ___class_getitem___[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-purpose-of-class-getitem "Link to this heading")
The purpose of [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") is to allow runtime parameterization of standard-library generic classes in order to more easily apply [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type-hint) to these classes.
To implement custom generic classes that can be parameterized at runtime and understood by static type-checkers, users should either inherit from a standard library class that already implements [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__"), or inherit from [`typing.Generic`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic "typing.Generic"), which has its own implementation of `__class_getitem__()`.
Custom implementations of [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") on classes defined outside of the standard library may not be understood by third-party type-checkers such as mypy. Using `__class_getitem__()` on any class for purposes other than type hinting is discouraged.
####  3.3.5.2. ___class_getitem___ versus ___getitem___[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#class-getitem-versus-getitem "Link to this heading")
Usually, the [subscription](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#subscriptions) of an object using square brackets will call the [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") instance method defined on the object’s class. However, if the object being subscribed is itself a class, the class method [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") may be called instead. `__class_getitem__()` should return a [GenericAlias](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-genericalias) object if it is properly defined.
Presented with the [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-expression) `obj[x]`, the Python interpreter follows something like the following process to decide whether [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") or [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") should be called:
Copy```
frominspectimport isclass

defsubscribe(obj, x):
"""Return the result of the expression 'obj[x]'"""

    class_of_obj = type(obj)

    # If the class of obj defines __getitem__,
    # call class_of_obj.__getitem__(obj, x)
    if hasattr(class_of_obj, '__getitem__'):
        return class_of_obj.__getitem__(obj, x)

    # Else, if obj is a class and defines __class_getitem__,
    # call obj.__class_getitem__(x)
    elif isclass(obj) and hasattr(obj, '__class_getitem__'):
        return obj.__class_getitem__(x)

    # Else, raise an exception
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            f"'{class_of_obj.__name__}' object is not subscriptable"
        )

```

In Python, all classes are themselves instances of other classes. The class of a class is known as that class’s [metaclass](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-metaclass), and most classes have the [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") class as their metaclass. [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") does not define [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"), meaning that expressions such as `list[int]`, `dict[str, float]` and `tuple[str, bytes]` all result in [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") being called:
Copy```
>>> # list has class "type" as its metaclass, like most classes:
>>> type(list)
<class 'type'>
>>> type(dict) == type(list) == type(tuple) == type(str) == type(bytes)
True
>>> # "list[int]" calls "list.__class_getitem__(int)"
>>> list[int]
list[int]
>>> # list.__class_getitem__ returns a GenericAlias object:
>>> type(list[int])
<class 'types.GenericAlias'>

```

However, if a class has a custom metaclass that defines [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"), subscribing the class may result in different behaviour. An example of this can be found in the [`enum`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#module-enum "enum: Implementation of an enumeration class.") module:
Copy```
>>> fromenumimport Enum
>>> classMenu(Enum):
... """A breakfast menu"""
...     SPAM = 'spam'
...     BACON = 'bacon'
...
>>> # Enum classes have a custom metaclass:
>>> type(Menu)
<class 'enum.EnumMeta'>
>>> # EnumMeta defines __getitem__,
>>> # so __class_getitem__ is not called,
>>> # and the result is not a GenericAlias object:
>>> Menu['SPAM']
<Menu.SPAM: 'spam'>
>>> type(Menu['SPAM'])
<enum 'Menu'>

```

###  3.3.6. Emulating callable objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-callable-objects "Link to this heading") 

object.__call__(_self_[, _args..._])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when the instance is “called” as a function; if this method is defined, `x(arg1, arg2, ...)` roughly translates to `type(x).__call__(x, arg1, ...)`. The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not provide this method.
###  3.3.7. Emulating container types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types "Link to this heading")
The following methods can be defined to implement container objects. None of them are provided by the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself. Containers usually are [sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) (such as [`lists`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") or [`tuples`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")) or [mappings](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping) (like [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-dictionary)), but can represent other containers as well. The first set of methods is used either to emulate a sequence or to emulate a mapping; the difference is that for a sequence, the allowable keys should be the integers _k_ for which `0 <= k < N` where _N_ is the length of the sequence, or [`slice`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice "slice") objects, which define a range of items. It is also recommended that mappings provide the methods `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `clear()`, `setdefault()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`, `copy()`, and `update()` behaving similar to those for Python’s standard [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") objects. The [`collections.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers") module provides a [`MutableMapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableMapping "collections.abc.MutableMapping") [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class) to help create those methods from a base set of [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"), [`__setitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setitem__ "object.__setitem__"), [`__delitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delitem__ "object.__delitem__"), and `keys()`. Mutable sequences should provide methods [`append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.append "sequence.append"), [`count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.count "sequence.count"), [`index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.index "sequence.index"), [`extend()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.extend "sequence.extend"), [`insert()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.insert "sequence.insert"), [`pop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.pop "sequence.pop"), [`remove()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.remove "sequence.remove"), [`reverse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence.reverse "sequence.reverse") and `sort()`, like Python standard [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") objects. Finally, sequence types should implement addition (meaning concatenation) and multiplication (meaning repetition) by defining the methods [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__"), [`__radd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "object.__radd__"), [`__iadd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__ "object.__iadd__"), [`__mul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mul__ "object.__mul__"), [`__rmul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmul__ "object.__rmul__") and [`__imul__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__imul__ "object.__imul__") described below; they should not define other numerical operators. It is recommended that both mappings and sequences implement the [`__contains__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__ "object.__contains__") method to allow efficient use of the `in` operator; for mappings, `in` should search the mapping’s keys; for sequences, it should search through the values. It is further recommended that both mappings and sequences implement the [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__ "object.__iter__") method to allow efficient iteration through the container; for mappings, `__iter__()` should iterate through the object’s keys; for sequences, it should iterate through the values. 

object.__len__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement the built-in function [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len"). Should return the length of the object, an integer `>=` 0. Also, an object that doesn’t define a [`__bool__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__ "object.__bool__") method and whose `__len__()` method returns zero is considered to be false in a Boolean context.
**CPython implementation detail:** In CPython, the length is required to be at most [`sys.maxsize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize "sys.maxsize"). If the length is larger than `sys.maxsize` some features (such as [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len")) may raise [`OverflowError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError"). To prevent raising `OverflowError` by truth value testing, an object must define a [`__bool__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__ "object.__bool__") method. 

object.__length_hint__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__length_hint__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement [`operator.length_hint()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.length_hint "operator.length_hint"). Should return an estimated length for the object (which may be greater or less than the actual length). The length must be an integer `>=` 0. The return value may also be [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented"), which is treated the same as if the `__length_hint__` method didn’t exist at all. This method is purely an optimization and is never required for correctness.
Added in version 3.4.
Note
Slicing is done exclusively with the following three methods. A call like
Copy```
a[1:2] = b

```

is translated to
Copy```
a[slice(1, 2, None)] = b

```

and so forth. Missing slice items are always filled in with `None`. 

object.__getitem__(_self_ , _key_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement evaluation of `self[key]`. For [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) types, the accepted keys should be integers. Optionally, they may support [`slice`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice "slice") objects as well. Negative index support is also optional. If _key_ is of an inappropriate type, [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") may be raised; if _key_ is a value outside the set of indexes for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values), [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError") should be raised. For [mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping) types, if _key_ is missing (not in the container), [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "KeyError") should be raised.
Note
[`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) loops expect that an [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError") will be raised for illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence.
Note
When [subscripting](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#subscriptions) a _class_ , the special class method [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") may be called instead of `__getitem__()`. See [__class_getitem__ versus __getitem__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classgetitem-versus-getitem) for more details. 

object.__setitem__(_self_ , _key_ , _value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setitem__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement assignment to `self[key]`. Same note as for [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"). This should only be implemented for mappings if the objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys can be added, or for sequences if elements can be replaced. The same exceptions should be raised for improper _key_ values as for the [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") method. 

object.__delitem__(_self_ , _key_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__delitem__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement deletion of `self[key]`. Same note as for [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"). This should only be implemented for mappings if the objects support removal of keys, or for sequences if elements can be removed from the sequence. The same exceptions should be raised for improper _key_ values as for the [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") method. 

object.__missing__(_self_ , _key_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__missing__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called by [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict").[`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") to implement `self[key]` for dict subclasses when key is not in the dictionary. 

object.__iter__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__ "Link to this definition") 
    
This method is called when an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator) is required for a container. This method should return a new iterator object that can iterate over all the objects in the container. For mappings, it should iterate over the keys of the container. 

object.__reversed__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__reversed__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called (if present) by the [`reversed()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed "reversed") built-in to implement reverse iteration. It should return a new iterator object that iterates over all the objects in the container in reverse order.
If the [`__reversed__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__reversed__ "object.__reversed__") method is not provided, the [`reversed()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed "reversed") built-in will fall back to using the sequence protocol ([`__len__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__ "object.__len__") and [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__")). Objects that support the sequence protocol should only provide [`__reversed__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__reversed__ "object.__reversed__") if they can provide an implementation that is more efficient than the one provided by [`reversed()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed "reversed").
The membership test operators ([`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) and [`not in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not-in)) are normally implemented as an iteration through a container. However, container objects can supply the following special method with a more efficient implementation, which also does not require the object be iterable. 

object.__contains__(_self_ , _item_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement membership test operators. Should return true if _item_ is in _self_ , false otherwise. For mapping objects, this should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or the key-item pairs.
For objects that don’t define [`__contains__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__ "object.__contains__"), the membership test first tries iteration via [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__ "object.__iter__"), then the old sequence iteration protocol via [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__"), see [this section in the language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-details).
###  3.3.8. Emulating numeric types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types "Link to this heading")
The following methods can be defined to emulate numeric objects. Methods corresponding to operations that are not supported by the particular kind of number implemented (e.g., bitwise operations for non-integral numbers) should be left undefined. 

object.__add__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__sub__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__sub__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__mul__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mul__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__matmul__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__matmul__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__truediv__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__truediv__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__floordiv__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__floordiv__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__mod__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mod__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__divmod__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__divmod__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__pow__(_self_ , _other_[, _modulo_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pow__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__lshift__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lshift__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rshift__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rshift__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__and__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__and__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__xor__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__xor__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__or__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__or__ "Link to this definition") 
    
These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `@`, `/`, `//`, `%`, [`divmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod "divmod"), [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow "pow"), `**`, `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `^`, `|`). For instance, to evaluate the expression `x + y`, where _x_ is an instance of a class that has an [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__") method, `type(x).__add__(x, y)` is called. The [`__divmod__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__divmod__ "object.__divmod__") method should be the equivalent to using [`__floordiv__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__floordiv__ "object.__floordiv__") and [`__mod__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mod__ "object.__mod__"); it should not be related to [`__truediv__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__truediv__ "object.__truediv__"). Note that [`__pow__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pow__ "object.__pow__") should be defined to accept an optional third argument if the ternary version of the built-in [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow "pow") function is to be supported.
If one of those methods does not support the operation with the supplied arguments, it should return [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented"). 

object.__radd__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rsub__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rsub__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rmul__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmul__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rmatmul__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmatmul__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rtruediv__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rtruediv__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rfloordiv__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rfloordiv__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rmod__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rmod__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rdivmod__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rdivmod__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rpow__(_self_ , _other_[, _modulo_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rpow__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rlshift__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rlshift__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rrshift__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rrshift__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rand__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rand__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__rxor__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rxor__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ror__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ror__ "Link to this definition") 
    
These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `@`, `/`, `//`, `%`, [`divmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod "divmod"), [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow "pow"), `**`, `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `^`, `|`) with reflected (swapped) operands. These functions are only called if the left operand does not support the corresponding operation [[3]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id21) and the operands are of different types. [[4]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id22) For instance, to evaluate the expression `x - y`, where _y_ is an instance of a class that has an [`__rsub__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rsub__ "object.__rsub__") method, `type(y).__rsub__(y, x)` is called if `type(x).__sub__(x, y)` returns [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented").
Note that ternary [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow "pow") will not try calling [`__rpow__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rpow__ "object.__rpow__") (the coercion rules would become too complicated).
Note
If the right operand’s type is a subclass of the left operand’s type and that subclass provides a different implementation of the reflected method for the operation, this method will be called before the left operand’s non-reflected method. This behavior allows subclasses to override their ancestors’ operations. 

object.__iadd__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__isub__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__isub__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__imul__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__imul__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__imatmul__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__imatmul__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__itruediv__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__itruediv__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ifloordiv__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ifloordiv__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__imod__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__imod__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ipow__(_self_ , _other_[, _modulo_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ipow__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ilshift__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ilshift__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__irshift__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__irshift__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__iand__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iand__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ixor__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ixor__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ior__(_self_ , _other_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ior__ "Link to this definition") 
    
These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `@=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `&=`, `^=`, `|=`). These methods should attempt to do the operation in-place (modifying _self_) and return the result (which could be, but does not have to be, _self_). If a specific method is not defined, or if that method returns [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented"), the augmented assignment falls back to the normal methods. For instance, if _x_ is an instance of a class with an [`__iadd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__ "object.__iadd__") method, `x += y` is equivalent to `x = x.__iadd__(y)` . If [`__iadd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__ "object.__iadd__") does not exist, or if `x.__iadd__(y)` returns `NotImplemented`, `x.__add__(y)` and `y.__radd__(x)` are considered, as with the evaluation of `x + y`. In certain situations, augmented assignment can result in unexpected errors (see [Why does a_tuple[i] += [‘item’] raise an exception when the addition works?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#faq-augmented-assignment-tuple-error)), but this behavior is in fact part of the data model. 

object.__neg__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__neg__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__pos__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pos__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__abs__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__abs__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__invert__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__invert__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement the unary arithmetic operations (`-`, `+`, [`abs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs "abs") and `~`). 

object.__complex__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__complex__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__int__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__int__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__float__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__float__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement the built-in functions [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex "complex"), [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") and [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float"). Should return a value of the appropriate type. 

object.__index__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement [`operator.index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.index "operator.index"), and whenever Python needs to losslessly convert the numeric object to an integer object (such as in slicing, or in the built-in [`bin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bin "bin"), [`hex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hex "hex") and [`oct()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#oct "oct") functions). Presence of this method indicates that the numeric object is an integer type. Must return an integer.
If [`__int__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__int__ "object.__int__"), [`__float__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__float__ "object.__float__") and [`__complex__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__complex__ "object.__complex__") are not defined then corresponding built-in functions [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"), [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float") and [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex "complex") fall back to [`__index__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__ "object.__index__"). 

object.__round__(_self_[, _ndigits_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__round__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__trunc__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__trunc__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__floor__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__floor__ "Link to this definition") 


object.__ceil__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ceil__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called to implement the built-in function [`round()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round "round") and [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math "math: Mathematical functions \(sin\(\) etc.\).") functions [`trunc()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.trunc "math.trunc"), [`floor()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.floor "math.floor") and [`ceil()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.ceil "math.ceil"). Unless _ndigits_ is passed to `__round__()` all these methods should return the value of the object truncated to an [`Integral`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Integral "numbers.Integral") (typically an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int")).
The built-in function [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") falls back to [`__trunc__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__trunc__ "object.__trunc__") if neither [`__int__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__int__ "object.__int__") nor [`__index__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__ "object.__index__") is defined.
Changed in version 3.11: The delegation of [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") to [`__trunc__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__trunc__ "object.__trunc__") is deprecated.
###  3.3.9. With Statement Context Managers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers "Link to this heading")
A _context manager_ is an object that defines the runtime context to be established when executing a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement. The context manager handles the entry into, and the exit from, the desired runtime context for the execution of the block of code. Context managers are normally invoked using the `with` statement (described in section [The with statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)), but can also be used by directly invoking their methods.
Typical uses of context managers include saving and restoring various kinds of global state, locking and unlocking resources, closing opened files, etc.
For more information on context managers, see [Context Manager Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager). The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not provide the context manager methods. 

object.__enter__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Enter the runtime context related to this object. The [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement will bind this method’s return value to the target(s) specified in the `as` clause of the statement, if any. 

object.__exit__(_self_ , _exc_type_ , _exc_value_ , _traceback_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Exit the runtime context related to this object. The parameters describe the exception that caused the context to be exited. If the context was exited without an exception, all three arguments will be [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None").
If an exception is supplied, and the method wishes to suppress the exception (i.e., prevent it from being propagated), it should return a true value. Otherwise, the exception will be processed normally upon exit from this method.
Note that [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") methods should not reraise the passed-in exception; this is the caller’s responsibility.

The specification, background, and examples for the Python [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.
###  3.3.10. Customizing positional arguments in class pattern matching[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-positional-arguments-in-class-pattern-matching "Link to this heading")
When using a class name in a pattern, positional arguments in the pattern are not allowed by default, i.e. `case MyClass(x, y)` is typically invalid without special support in `MyClass`. To be able to use that kind of pattern, the class needs to define a ___match_args___ attribute. 

object.__match_args__[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__match_args__ "Link to this definition") 
    
This class variable can be assigned a tuple of strings. When this class is used in a class pattern with positional arguments, each positional argument will be converted into a keyword argument, using the corresponding value in ___match_args___ as the keyword. The absence of this attribute is equivalent to setting it to `()`.
For example, if `MyClass.__match_args__` is `("left", "center", "right")` that means that `case MyClass(x, y)` is equivalent to `case MyClass(left=x, center=y)`. Note that the number of arguments in the pattern must be smaller than or equal to the number of elements in ___match_args___ ; if it is larger, the pattern match attempt will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
Added in version 3.10.

###  3.3.11. Emulating buffer types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-buffer-types "Link to this heading")
The [buffer protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) provides a way for Python objects to expose efficient access to a low-level memory array. This protocol is implemented by builtin types such as [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview"), and third-party libraries may define additional buffer types.
While buffer types are usually implemented in C, it is also possible to implement the protocol in Python. 

object.__buffer__(_self_ , _flags_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__buffer__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when a buffer is requested from _self_ (for example, by the [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") constructor). The _flags_ argument is an integer representing the kind of buffer requested, affecting for example whether the returned buffer is read-only or writable. [`inspect.BufferFlags`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.BufferFlags "inspect.BufferFlags") provides a convenient way to interpret the flags. The method must return a [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") object. 

object.__release_buffer__(_self_ , _buffer_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__release_buffer__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Called when a buffer is no longer needed. The _buffer_ argument is a [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") object that was previously returned by [`__buffer__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__buffer__ "object.__buffer__"). The method must release any resources associated with the buffer. This method should return `None`. Buffer objects that do not need to perform any cleanup are not required to implement this method.
Added in version 3.12.

ABC for buffer types.
###  3.3.12. Special method lookup[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-lookup "Link to this heading")
For custom classes, implicit invocations of special methods are only guaranteed to work correctly if defined on an object’s type, not in the object’s instance dictionary. That behaviour is the reason why the following code raises an exception:
Copy```
>>> classC:
...     pass
...
>>> c = C()
>>> c.__len__ = lambda: 5
>>> len(c)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: object of type 'C' has no len()

```

The rationale behind this behaviour lies with a number of special methods such as [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__") and [`__repr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__ "object.__repr__") that are implemented by all objects, including type objects. If the implicit lookup of these methods used the conventional lookup process, they would fail when invoked on the type object itself:
Copy```
>>> 1 .__hash__() == hash(1)
True
>>> int.__hash__() == hash(int)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: descriptor '__hash__' of 'int' object needs an argument

```

Incorrectly attempting to invoke an unbound method of a class in this way is sometimes referred to as ‘metaclass confusion’, and is avoided by bypassing the instance when looking up special methods:
Copy```
>>> type(1).__hash__(1) == hash(1)
True
>>> type(int).__hash__(int) == hash(int)
True

```

In addition to bypassing any instance attributes in the interest of correctness, implicit special method lookup generally also bypasses the [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") method even of the object’s metaclass:
Copy```
>>> classMeta(type):
...     def__getattribute__(*args):
...         print("Metaclass getattribute invoked")
...         return type.__getattribute__(*args)
...
>>> classC(object, metaclass=Meta):
...     def__len__(self):
...         return 10
...     def__getattribute__(*args):
...         print("Class getattribute invoked")
...         return object.__getattribute__(*args)
...
>>> c = C()
>>> c.__len__()                 # Explicit lookup via instance
Class getattribute invoked
10
>>> type(c).__len__(c)          # Explicit lookup via type
Metaclass getattribute invoked
10
>>> len(c)                      # Implicit lookup
10

```

Bypassing the [`__getattribute__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__ "object.__getattribute__") machinery in this fashion provides significant scope for speed optimisations within the interpreter, at the cost of some flexibility in the handling of special methods (the special method _must_ be set on the class object itself in order to be consistently invoked by the interpreter).
##  3.4. Coroutines[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutines "Link to this heading")
###  3.4.1. Awaitable Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#awaitable-objects "Link to this heading")
An [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) object generally implements an [`__await__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__ "object.__await__") method. [Coroutine objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine) returned from [`async def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) functions are awaitable.
Note
The [generator iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator-iterator) objects returned from generators decorated with [`types.coroutine()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.coroutine "types.coroutine") are also awaitable, but they do not implement [`__await__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__ "object.__await__"). 

object.__await__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Must return an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator). Should be used to implement [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) objects. For instance, [`asyncio.Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") implements this method to be compatible with the [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await) expression. The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself is not awaitable and does not provide this method.
Note
The language doesn’t place any restriction on the type or value of the objects yielded by the iterator returned by `__await__`, as this is specific to the implementation of the asynchronous execution framework (e.g. [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.")) that will be managing the [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) object.
Added in version 3.5.
See also
[**PEP 492**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/) for additional information about awaitable objects.
###  3.4.2. Coroutine Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine-objects "Link to this heading")
[Coroutine objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine) are [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable) objects. A coroutine’s execution can be controlled by calling [`__await__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__ "object.__await__") and iterating over the result. When the coroutine has finished executing and returns, the iterator raises [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"), and the exception’s [`value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration.value "StopIteration.value") attribute holds the return value. If the coroutine raises an exception, it is propagated by the iterator. Coroutines should not directly raise unhandled [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exceptions.
Coroutines also have the methods listed below, which are analogous to those of generators (see [Generator-iterator methods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-methods)). However, unlike generators, coroutines do not directly support iteration.
Changed in version 3.5.2: It is a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") to await on a coroutine more than once. 

coroutine.send(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine.send "Link to this definition") 
    
Starts or resumes execution of the coroutine. If _value_ is `None`, this is equivalent to advancing the iterator returned by [`__await__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__ "object.__await__"). If _value_ is not `None`, this method delegates to the [`send()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send "generator.send") method of the iterator that caused the coroutine to suspend. The result (return value, [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"), or other exception) is the same as when iterating over the `__await__()` return value, described above. 

coroutine.throw(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine.throw "Link to this definition") 


coroutine.throw(_type_[, _value_[, _traceback_]]) 
    
Raises the specified exception in the coroutine. This method delegates to the [`throw()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.throw "generator.throw") method of the iterator that caused the coroutine to suspend, if it has such a method. Otherwise, the exception is raised at the suspension point. The result (return value, [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"), or other exception) is the same as when iterating over the [`__await__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__ "object.__await__") return value, described above. If the exception is not caught in the coroutine, it propagates back to the caller.
Changed in version 3.12: The second signature (type[, value[, traceback]]) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Python. 

coroutine.close()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine.close "Link to this definition") 
    
Causes the coroutine to clean itself up and exit. If the coroutine is suspended, this method first delegates to the [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close") method of the iterator that caused the coroutine to suspend, if it has such a method. Then it raises [`GeneratorExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#GeneratorExit "GeneratorExit") at the suspension point, causing the coroutine to immediately clean itself up. Finally, the coroutine is marked as having finished executing, even if it was never started.
Coroutine objects are automatically closed using the above process when they are about to be destroyed.
###  3.4.3. Asynchronous Iterators[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-iterators "Link to this heading")
An _asynchronous iterator_ can call asynchronous code in its `__anext__` method.
Asynchronous iterators can be used in an [`async for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for) statement.
The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not provide these methods. 

object.__aiter__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aiter__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Must return an _asynchronous iterator_ object. 

object.__anext__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__anext__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Must return an _awaitable_ resulting in a next value of the iterator. Should raise a [`StopAsyncIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "StopAsyncIteration") error when the iteration is over.
An example of an asynchronous iterable object:
Copy```
classReader:
    async defreadline(self):
        ...

    def__aiter__(self):
        return self

    async def__anext__(self):
        val = await self.readline()
        if val == b'':
            raise StopAsyncIteration
        return val

```

Added in version 3.5.
Changed in version 3.7: Prior to Python 3.7, [`__aiter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aiter__ "object.__aiter__") could return an _awaitable_ that would resolve to an [asynchronous iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator).
Starting with Python 3.7, [`__aiter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aiter__ "object.__aiter__") must return an asynchronous iterator object. Returning anything else will result in a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") error.
###  3.4.4. Asynchronous Context Managers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-context-managers "Link to this heading")
An _asynchronous context manager_ is a _context manager_ that is able to suspend execution in its `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods.
Asynchronous context managers can be used in an [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with) statement.
The [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") class itself does not provide these methods. 

object.__aenter__(_self_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aenter__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Semantically similar to [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__"), the only difference being that it must return an _awaitable_. 

object.__aexit__(_self_ , _exc_type_ , _exc_value_ , _traceback_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "Link to this definition") 
    
Semantically similar to [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__"), the only difference being that it must return an _awaitable_.
An example of an asynchronous context manager class:
Copy```
classAsyncContextManager:
    async def__aenter__(self):
        await log('entering context')

    async def__aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        await log('exiting context')

```

Added in version 3.5.
Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id1)]
It _is_ possible in some cases to change an object’s type, under certain controlled conditions. It generally isn’t a good idea though, since it can lead to some very strange behaviour if it is handled incorrectly.
[[2](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id12)]
The [`__hash__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__ "object.__hash__"), [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__ "object.__iter__"), [`__reversed__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__reversed__ "object.__reversed__"), [`__contains__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__ "object.__contains__"), [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") and [`__fspath__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike.__fspath__ "os.PathLike.__fspath__") methods have special handling for this. Others will still raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"), but may do so by relying on the behavior that `None` is not callable.
[[3](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id16)]
“Does not support” here means that the class has no such method, or the method returns [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented"). Do not set the method to `None` if you want to force fallback to the right operand’s reflected method—that will instead have the opposite effect of explicitly _blocking_ such fallback.
[[4](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#id17)]
For operands of the same type, it is assumed that if the non-reflected method – such as [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__") – fails then the overall operation is not supported, which is why the reflected method is not called.

#  16. Appendix[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#appendix "Link to this heading")
##  16.1. Interactive Mode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#interactive-mode "Link to this heading")
There are two variants of the interactive [REPL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-REPL). The classic basic interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control capabilities.
On Windows, or Unix-like systems with [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") support, a new interactive shell is used by default since Python 3.13. This one supports color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode. To disable color, see [Controlling color](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color) for details. Function keys provide some additional functionality. `F1` enters the interactive help browser [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system."). `F2` allows for browsing command-line history with neither output nor the [>>>](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-0) and […](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-...) prompts. `F3` enters “paste mode”, which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. Press `F3` to return to the regular prompt.
When using the new interactive shell, exit the shell by typing `exit` or `quit`. Adding call parentheses after those commands is not required.
If the new interactive shell is not desired, it can be disabled via the [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL) environment variable.
###  16.1.1. Error Handling[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#error-handling "Link to this heading")
When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause in a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement are not errors in this context.) Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output.
Typing the interrupt character (usually `Control`-`C` or `Delete`) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#id2) Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") exception, which may be handled by a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement.
###  16.1.2. Executable Python Scripts[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#executable-python-scripts "Link to this heading")
On BSD’ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line
Copy```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

```

(assuming that the interpreter is on the user’s `PATH`) at the beginning of the script and giving the file an executable mode. The `#!` must be the first two characters of the file. On some platforms, this first line must end with a Unix-style line ending (`'\n'`), not a Windows (`'\r\n'`) line ending. Note that the hash, or pound, character, `'#'`, is used to start a comment in Python.
The script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using the **chmod** command.
```
$ chmod
```

On Windows systems, there is no notion of an “executable mode”. The Python installer automatically associates `.py` files with `python.exe` so that a double-click on a Python file will run it as a script. The extension can also be `.pyw`, in that case, the console window that normally appears is suppressed.
###  16.1.3. The Interactive Startup File[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#the-interactive-startup-file "Link to this heading")
When you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some standard commands executed every time the interpreter is started. You can do this by setting an environment variable named [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) to the name of a file containing your start-up commands. This is similar to the `.profile` feature of the Unix shells.
This file is only read in interactive sessions, not when Python reads commands from a script, and not when `/dev/tty` is given as the explicit source of commands (which otherwise behaves like an interactive session). It is executed in the same namespace where interactive commands are executed, so that objects that it defines or imports can be used without qualification in the interactive session. You can also change the prompts `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` in this file.
If you want to read an additional start-up file from the current directory, you can program this in the global start-up file using code like `if os.path.isfile('.pythonrc.py'): exec(open('.pythonrc.py').read())`. If you want to use the startup file in a script, you must do this explicitly in the script:
Copy```
importos
filename = os.environ.get('PYTHONSTARTUP')
if filename and os.path.isfile(filename):
    with open(filename) as fobj:
        startup_file = fobj.read()
    exec(startup_file)

```

###  16.1.4. The Customization Modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#the-customization-modules "Link to this heading")
Python provides two hooks to let you customize it: 
Copy```
>>> importsite
>>> site.getusersitepackages()
'/home/user/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages'

```

Now you can create a file named `usercustomize.py` in that directory and put anything you want in it. It will affect every invocation of Python, unless it is started with the [`-s`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-s) option to disable the automatic import.
[`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") module for more details.

#  8. Errors and Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#errors-and-exceptions "Link to this heading")
Until now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: _syntax errors_ and _exceptions_.
##  8.1. Syntax Errors[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#syntax-errors "Link to this heading")
Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:
Copy```
>>> while True print('Hello world')
  File "<stdin>", line 1
while True print('Hello world')
^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

The parser repeats the offending line and displays little arrows pointing at the place where the error was detected. Note that this is not always the place that needs to be fixed. In the example, the error is detected at the function [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print"), since a colon (`':'`) is missing just before it.
The file name (`<stdin>` in our example) and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a file.
##  8.2. Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exceptions "Link to this heading")
Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called _exceptions_ and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here:
Copy```
>>> 10 * (1/0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
10 * (1/0)
~^~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>> 4 + spam*3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
4 + spam*3
^^^^
NameError: name 'spam' is not defined
>>> '2' + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
'2' + 2
~~~~^~~
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

```

The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message: the types in the example are [`ZeroDivisionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "ZeroDivisionError"), [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError") and [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred. This is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-defined exceptions (although it is a useful convention). Standard exception names are built-in identifiers (not reserved keywords).
The rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what caused it.
The preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception occurred, in the form of a stack traceback. In general it contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display lines read from standard input.
[Built-in Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions) lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.
##  8.3. Handling Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions "Link to this heading")
It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using `Control`-`C` or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") exception.
Copy```
>>> while True:
...     try:
...         x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
...         break
...     except ValueError:
...         print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
...

```

The [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement works as follows.
  * First, the _try clause_ (the statement(s) between the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) and [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) keywords) is executed.
  * If no exception occurs, the _except clause_ is skipped and execution of the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement is finished.
  * If an exception occurs during execution of the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then, if its type matches the exception named after the [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) keyword, the _except clause_ is executed, and then execution continues after the try/except block.
  * If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the _except clause_ , it is passed on to outer [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statements; if no handler is found, it is an _unhandled exception_ and execution stops with an error message.


A [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement may have more than one _except clause_ , to specify handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding _try clause_ , not in other handlers of the same `try` statement. An _except clause_ may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for example:
Copy```
... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):
...     pass

```

A class in an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause matches exceptions which are instances of the class itself or one of its derived classes (but not the other way around — an _except clause_ listing a derived class does not match instances of its base classes). For example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order:
Copy```
classB(Exception):
    pass

classC(B):
    pass

classD(C):
    pass

for cls in [B, C, D]:
    try:
        raise cls()
    except D:
        print("D")
    except C:
        print("C")
    except B:
        print("B")

```

Note that if the _except clauses_ were reversed (with `except B` first), it would have printed B, B, B — the first matching _except clause_ is triggered.
When an exception occurs, it may have associated values, also known as the exception’s _arguments_. The presence and types of the arguments depend on the exception type.
The _except clause_ may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to the exception instance which typically has an `args` attribute that stores the arguments. For convenience, builtin exception types define [`__str__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "object.__str__") to print all the arguments without explicitly accessing `.args`.
Copy```
>>> try:
...     raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
... except Exception as inst:
...     print(type(inst))    # the exception type
...     print(inst.args)     # arguments stored in .args
...     print(inst)          # __str__ allows args to be printed directly,
...                          # but may be overridden in exception subclasses
...     x, y = inst.args     # unpack args
...     print('x =', x)
...     print('y =', y)
...
<class 'Exception'>
('spam', 'eggs')
('spam', 'eggs')
x = spam
y = eggs

```

The exception’s [`__str__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__ "object.__str__") output is printed as the last part (‘detail’) of the message for unhandled exceptions.
[`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException") is the common base class of all exceptions. One of its subclasses, [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception"), is the base class of all the non-fatal exceptions. Exceptions which are not subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") are not typically handled, because they are used to indicate that the program should terminate. They include [`SystemExit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit "SystemExit") which is raised by [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit") and [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") which is raised when a user wishes to interrupt the program.
[`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") can be used as a wildcard that catches (almost) everything. However, it is good practice to be as specific as possible with the types of exceptions that we intend to handle, and to allow any unexpected exceptions to propagate on.
The most common pattern for handling [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") is to print or log the exception and then re-raise it (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well):
Copy```
importsys

try:
    f = open('myfile.txt')
    s = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())
except OSError as err:
    print("OS error:", err)
except ValueError:
    print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
except Exception as err:
    print(f"Unexpected {err=}, {type(err)=}")
    raise

```

The [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) … [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) statement has an optional _else clause_ , which, when present, must follow all _except clauses_. It is useful for code that must be executed if the _try clause_ does not raise an exception. For example:
Copy```
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    try:
        f = open(arg, 'r')
    except OSError:
        print('cannot open', arg)
    else:
        print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
        f.close()

```

The use of the `else` clause is better than adding additional code to the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by the `try` … `except` statement.
Exception handlers do not handle only exceptions that occur immediately in the _try clause_ , but also those that occur inside functions that are called (even indirectly) in the _try clause_. For example:
Copy```
>>> defthis_fails():
...     x = 1/0
...
>>> try:
...     this_fails()
... except ZeroDivisionError as err:
...     print('Handling run-time error:', err)
...
Handling run-time error: division by zero

```

##  8.4. Raising Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions "Link to this heading")
The [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur. For example:
Copy```
>>> raise NameError('HiThere')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
raise NameError('HiThere')
NameError: HiThere

```

The sole argument to [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that derives from [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException"), such as [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") or one of its subclasses). If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by calling its constructor with no arguments:
Copy```
raise ValueError  # shorthand for 'raise ValueError()'

```

If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don’t intend to handle it, a simpler form of the [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) statement allows you to re-raise the exception:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     raise NameError('HiThere')
... except NameError:
...     print('An exception flew by!')
...     raise
...
An exception flew by!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
raise NameError('HiThere')
NameError: HiThere

```

##  8.5. Exception Chaining[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exception-chaining "Link to this heading")
If an unhandled exception occurs inside an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) section, it will have the exception being handled attached to it and included in the error message:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     open("database.sqlite")
... except OSError:
...     raise RuntimeError("unable to handle error")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
open("database.sqlite")
~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'database.sqlite'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
raise RuntimeError("unable to handle error")
RuntimeError: unable to handle error

```

To indicate that an exception is a direct consequence of another, the [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) statement allows an optional [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) clause:
Copy```
# exc must be exception instance or None.
raise RuntimeError fromexc

```

This can be useful when you are transforming exceptions. For example:
Copy```
>>> deffunc():
...     raise ConnectionError
...
>>> try:
...     func()
... except ConnectionError as exc:
...     raise RuntimeError('Failed to open database') fromexc
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
func()
~~~~^^
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in func
ConnectionError

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
raise RuntimeError('Failed to open database') fromexc
RuntimeError: Failed to open database

```

It also allows disabling automatic exception chaining using the `from None` idiom:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     open('database.sqlite')
... except OSError:
...     raise RuntimeError fromNone
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
raise RuntimeError fromNone
RuntimeError

```

For more information about chaining mechanics, see [Built-in Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions).
##  8.6. User-defined Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions "Link to this heading")
Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class (see [Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more about Python classes). Exceptions should typically be derived from the [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") class, either directly or indirectly.
Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number of attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the exception.
Most exceptions are defined with names that end in “Error”, similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.
Many standard modules define their own exceptions to report errors that may occur in functions they define.
##  8.7. Defining Clean-up Actions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#defining-clean-up-actions "Link to this heading")
The [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement has another optional clause which is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances. For example:
Copy```
>>> try:
...     raise KeyboardInterrupt
... finally:
...     print('Goodbye, world!')
...
Goodbye, world!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
raise KeyboardInterrupt
KeyboardInterrupt

```

If a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause is present, the `finally` clause will execute as the last task before the [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement completes. The `finally` clause runs whether or not the `try` statement produces an exception. The following points discuss more complex cases when an exception occurs:
  * If an exception occurs during execution of the `try` clause, the exception may be handled by an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause. If the exception is not handled by an `except` clause, the exception is re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.
  * An exception could occur during execution of an `except` or `else` clause. Again, the exception is re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.
  * If the `finally` clause executes a [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) or [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement, exceptions are not re-raised.
  * If the `try` statement reaches a [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) or [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement, the `finally` clause will execute just prior to the `break`, `continue` or `return` statement’s execution.
  * If a `finally` clause includes a `return` statement, the returned value will be the one from the `finally` clause’s `return` statement, not the value from the `try` clause’s `return` statement.


For example:
Copy```
>>> defbool_return():
...     try:
...         return True
...     finally:
...         return False
...
>>> bool_return()
False

```

A more complicated example:
Copy```
>>> defdivide(x, y):
...     try:
...         result = x / y
...     except ZeroDivisionError:
...         print("division by zero!")
...     else:
...         print("result is", result)
...     finally:
...         print("executing finally clause")
...
>>> divide(2, 1)
result is 2.0
executing finally clause
>>> divide(2, 0)
division by zero!
executing finally clause
>>> divide("2", "1")
executing finally clause
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
divide("2", "1")
~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in divide
result = x / y
~~^~~
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'

```

As you can see, the [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause is executed in any event. The [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") raised by dividing two strings is not handled by the [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause and therefore re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.
In real world applications, the [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause is useful for releasing external resources (such as files or network connections), regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.
##  8.8. Predefined Clean-up Actions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#predefined-clean-up-actions "Link to this heading")
Some objects define standard clean-up actions to be undertaken when the object is no longer needed, regardless of whether or not the operation using the object succeeded or failed. Look at the following example, which tries to open a file and print its contents to the screen.
Copy```
for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end="")

```

The problem with this code is that it leaves the file open for an indeterminate amount of time after this part of the code has finished executing. This is not an issue in simple scripts, but can be a problem for larger applications. The [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement allows objects like files to be used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up promptly and correctly.
Copy```
with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")

```

After the statement is executed, the file _f_ is always closed, even if a problem was encountered while processing the lines. Objects which, like files, provide predefined clean-up actions will indicate this in their documentation.
##  8.9. Raising and Handling Multiple Unrelated Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-and-handling-multiple-unrelated-exceptions "Link to this heading")
There are situations where it is necessary to report several exceptions that have occurred. This is often the case in concurrency frameworks, when several tasks may have failed in parallel, but there are also other use cases where it is desirable to continue execution and collect multiple errors rather than raise the first exception.
The builtin [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup") wraps a list of exception instances so that they can be raised together. It is an exception itself, so it can be caught like any other exception.
Copy```
>>> deff():
...     excs = [OSError('error 1'), SystemError('error 2')]
...     raise ExceptionGroup('there were problems', excs)
...
>>> f()
  + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last):
  |   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  |     f()
  |     ~^^
  |   File "<stdin>", line 3, in f
  |     raise ExceptionGroup('there were problems', excs)
  | ExceptionGroup: there were problems (2 sub-exceptions)
  +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | OSError: error 1
    +---------------- 2 ----------------
    | SystemError: error 2
    +------------------------------------
>>> try:
...     f()
... except Exception as e:
...     print(f'caught {type(e)}: e')
...
caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'>: e
>>>

```

By using `except*` instead of `except`, we can selectively handle only the exceptions in the group that match a certain type. In the following example, which shows a nested exception group, each `except*` clause extracts from the group exceptions of a certain type while letting all other exceptions propagate to other clauses and eventually to be reraised.
Copy```
>>> deff():
...     raise ExceptionGroup(
...         "group1",
...         [
...             OSError(1),
...             SystemError(2),
...             ExceptionGroup(
...                 "group2",
...                 [
...                     OSError(3),
...                     RecursionError(4)
...                 ]
...             )
...         ]
...     )
...
>>> try:
...     f()
... except* OSError as e:
...     print("There were OSErrors")
... except* SystemError as e:
...     print("There were SystemErrors")
...
There were OSErrors
There were SystemErrors
  + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last):
  |   File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
  |     f()
  |     ~^^
  |   File "<stdin>", line 2, in f
  |     raise ExceptionGroup(
  |     ...<12 lines>...
  |     )
  | ExceptionGroup: group1 (1 sub-exception)
  +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | ExceptionGroup: group2 (1 sub-exception)
    +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
      | RecursionError: 4
      +------------------------------------
>>>

```

Note that the exceptions nested in an exception group must be instances, not types. This is because in practice the exceptions would typically be ones that have already been raised and caught by the program, along the following pattern:
Copy```
>>> excs = []
... for test in tests:
...     try:
...         test.run()
...     except Exception as e:
...         excs.append(e)
...
>>> if excs:
...    raise ExceptionGroup("Test Failures", excs)
...

```

##  8.10. Enriching Exceptions with Notes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#enriching-exceptions-with-notes "Link to this heading")
When an exception is created in order to be raised, it is usually initialized with information that describes the error that has occurred. There are cases where it is useful to add information after the exception was caught. For this purpose, exceptions have a method `add_note(note)` that accepts a string and adds it to the exception’s notes list. The standard traceback rendering includes all notes, in the order they were added, after the exception.
Copy```
>>> try:
...     raise TypeError('bad type')
... except Exception as e:
...     e.add_note('Add some information')
...     e.add_note('Add some more information')
...     raise
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
raise TypeError('bad type')
TypeError: bad type
Add some information
Add some more information
>>>

```

For example, when collecting exceptions into an exception group, we may want to add context information for the individual errors. In the following each exception in the group has a note indicating when this error has occurred.
Copy```
>>> deff():
...     raise OSError('operation failed')
...
>>> excs = []
>>> for i in range(3):
...     try:
...         f()
...     except Exception as e:
...         e.add_note(f'Happened in Iteration {i+1}')
...         excs.append(e)
...
>>> raise ExceptionGroup('We have some problems', excs)
  + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last):
  |   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  |     raise ExceptionGroup('We have some problems', excs)
  | ExceptionGroup: We have some problems (3 sub-exceptions)
  +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | Traceback (most recent call last):
    |   File "<stdin>", line 3, in <module>
    |     f()
    |     ~^^
    |   File "<stdin>", line 2, in f
    |     raise OSError('operation failed')
    | OSError: operation failed
    | Happened in Iteration 1
    +---------------- 2 ----------------
    | Traceback (most recent call last):
    |   File "<stdin>", line 3, in <module>
    |     f()
    |     ~^^
    |   File "<stdin>", line 2, in f
    |     raise OSError('operation failed')
    | OSError: operation failed
    | Happened in Iteration 2
    +---------------- 3 ----------------
    | Traceback (most recent call last):
    |   File "<stdin>", line 3, in <module>
    |     f()
    |     ~^^
    |   File "<stdin>", line 2, in f
    |     raise OSError('operation failed')
    | OSError: operation failed
    | Happened in Iteration 3
    +------------------------------------

#  1. Whetting Your Appetite[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html#whetting-your-appetite "Link to this heading")
If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.
If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.
Python is just the language for you.
You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.
Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a _very-high-level language_ , it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.
Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.
Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.
Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
  * the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
  * statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
  * no variable or argument declarations are necessary.


Python is _extensible_ : if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.
By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!
Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.
In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.
The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.

#  14. Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.html#interactive-input-editing-and-history-substitution "Link to this heading")
Some versions of the Python interpreter support editing of the current input line and history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn shell and the GNU Bash shell. This is implemented using the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library, which supports various styles of editing. This library has its own documentation which we won’t duplicate here.
##  14.1. Tab Completion and History Editing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.html#tab-completion-and-history-editing "Link to this heading")
Completion of variable and module names is [automatically enabled](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#rlcompleter-config) at interpreter startup so that the `Tab` key invokes the completion function; it looks at Python statement names, the current local variables, and the available module names. For dotted expressions such as `string.a`, it will evaluate the expression up to the final `'.'` and then suggest completions from the attributes of the resulting object. Note that this may execute application-defined code if an object with a [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") method is part of the expression. The default configuration also saves your history into a file named `.python_history` in your user directory. The history will be available again during the next interactive interpreter session.
##  14.2. Alternatives to the Interactive Interpreter[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.html#alternatives-to-the-interactive-interpreter "Link to this heading")
This facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions of the interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if the proper indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser knows if an [`INDENT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/token.html#token.INDENT "token.INDENT") token is required next). The completion mechanism might use the interpreter’s symbol table. A command to check (or even suggest) matching parentheses, quotes, etc., would also be useful.
One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite some time is [IPython](https://ipython.org/), which features tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management. It can also be thoroughly customized and embedded into other applications. Another similar enhanced interactive environment is [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/).

#  9. Classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#classes "Link to this heading")
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new _type_ of object, allowing new _instances_ of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.
In C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are _public_ (except see below [Private Variables](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-private)), and all member functions are _virtual_. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.
(Lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, I will make occasional use of Smalltalk and C++ terms. I would use Modula-3 terms, since its object-oriented semantics are closer to those of Python than C++, but I expect that few readers have heard of it.)
##  9.1. A Word About Names and Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-word-about-names-and-objects "Link to this heading")
Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This is known as aliasing in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change — this eliminates the need for two different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal.
##  9.2. Python Scopes and Namespaces[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces "Link to this heading")
Before introducing classes, I first have to tell you something about Python’s scope rules. Class definitions play some neat tricks with namespaces, and you need to know how scopes and namespaces work to fully understand what’s going on. Incidentally, knowledge about this subject is useful for any advanced Python programmer.
Let’s begin with some definitions.
A _namespace_ is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as [`abs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs "abs"), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules may both define a function `maximize` without confusion — users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.
By the way, I use the word _attribute_ for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression `z.real`, `real` is an attribute of the object `z`. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression `modname.funcname`, `modname` is a module object and `funcname` is an attribute of it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace! [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#id2)
Attributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write `modname.the_answer = 42`. Writable attributes may also be deleted with the [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) statement. For example, `del modname.the_answer` will remove the attribute `the_answer` from the object named by `modname`.
Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``."), so they have their own global namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.").)
The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local namespace.
A _scope_ is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace.
Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are 3 or 4 nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:
  * the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
  * the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contain non-local, but also non-global names
  * the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names
  * the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names


If a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the next-to-last scope containing the module’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement can be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a _new_ local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable unchanged).
Usually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually) current function. Outside functions, the local scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module’s namespace. Class definitions place yet another namespace in the local scope.
It is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function defined in a module is that module’s namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called. On the other hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run time — however, the language definition is evolving towards static name resolution, at “compile” time, so don’t rely on dynamic name resolution! (In fact, local variables are already determined statically.)
A special quirk of Python is that – if no [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) or [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement is in effect – assignments to names always go into the innermost scope. Assignments do not copy data — they just bind names to objects. The same is true for deletions: the statement `del x` removes the binding of `x` from the namespace referenced by the local scope. In fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local scope: in particular, [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.
The [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there.
###  9.2.1. Scopes and Namespaces Example[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#scopes-and-namespaces-example "Link to this heading")
This is an example demonstrating how to reference the different scopes and namespaces, and how [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) and [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) affect variable binding:
Copy```
defscope_test():
    defdo_local():
        spam = "local spam"

    defdo_nonlocal():
        nonlocal spam
        spam = "nonlocal spam"

    defdo_global():
        global spam
        spam = "global spam"

    spam = "test spam"
    do_local()
    print("After local assignment:", spam)
    do_nonlocal()
    print("After nonlocal assignment:", spam)
    do_global()
    print("After global assignment:", spam)

scope_test()
print("In global scope:", spam)

```

The output of the example code is:
Note how the _local_ assignment (which is default) didn’t change _scope_test_ 's binding of _spam_. The [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) assignment changed _scope_test_ 's binding of _spam_ , and the [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) assignment changed the module-level binding.
You can also see that there was no previous binding for _spam_ before the [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) assignment.
##  9.3. A First Look at Classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes "Link to this heading")
Classes introduce a little bit of new syntax, three new object types, and some new semantics.
###  9.3.1. Class Definition Syntax[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax "Link to this heading")
The simplest form of class definition looks like this:
Copy```
classClassName:
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

```

Class definitions, like function definitions ([`def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#def) statements) must be executed before they have any effect. (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement, or inside a function.)
In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later. The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later.
When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new function here.
When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a _class object_ is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class definition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definition header (`ClassName` in the example).
###  9.3.2. Class Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects "Link to this heading")
Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.
_Attribute references_ use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: `obj.name`. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this:
Copy```
classMyClass:
"""A simple example class"""
    i = 12345

    deff(self):
        return 'hello world'

```

then `MyClass.i` and `MyClass.f` are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object, respectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of `MyClass.i` by assignment. [`__doc__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__doc__ "type.__doc__") is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: `"A simple example class"`.
Class _instantiation_ uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class):
Copy```
x = MyClass()

```

creates a new _instance_ of the class and assigns this object to the local variable `x`.
The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a class may define a special method named [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__"), like this:
Copy```
def__init__(self):
    self.data = []

```

When a class defines an [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method, class instantiation automatically invokes `__init__()` for the newly created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by:
Copy```
x = MyClass()

```

Of course, the [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method may have arguments for greater flexibility. In that case, arguments given to the class instantiation operator are passed on to `__init__()`. For example,
Copy```
>>> classComplex:
...     def__init__(self, realpart, imagpart):
...         self.r = realpart
...         self.i = imagpart
...
>>> x = Complex(3.0, -4.5)
>>> x.r, x.i
(3.0, -4.5)

```

###  9.3.3. Instance Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#instance-objects "Link to this heading")
Now what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute references. There are two kinds of valid attribute names: data attributes and methods.
_data attributes_ correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++. Data attributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are first assigned to. For example, if `x` is the instance of `MyClass` created above, the following piece of code will print the value `16`, without leaving a trace:
Copy```
x.counter = 1
while x.counter < 10:
    x.counter = x.counter * 2
print(x.counter)
del x.counter

```

The other kind of instance attribute reference is a _method_. A method is a function that “belongs to” an object.
Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, `x.f` is a valid method reference, since `MyClass.f` is a function, but `x.i` is not, since `MyClass.i` is not. But `x.f` is not the same thing as `MyClass.f` — it is a _method object_ , not a function object.
###  9.3.4. Method Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects "Link to this heading")
Usually, a method is called right after it is bound:
Copy```
x.f()

```

If `x = MyClass()`, as above, this will return the string `'hello world'`. However, it is not necessary to call a method right away: `x.f` is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example:
Copy```
xf = x.f
while True:
    print(xf())

```

will continue to print `hello world` until the end of time.
What exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that `x.f()` was called without an argument above, even though the function definition for `f()` specified an argument. What happened to the argument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without any — even if the argument isn’t actually used…
Actually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call `x.f()` is exactly equivalent to `MyClass.f(x)`. In general, calling a method with a list of _n_ arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the first argument.
In general, methods work as follows. When a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, references to both the instance object and the function object are packed into a method object. When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.
###  9.3.5. Class and Instance Variables[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables "Link to this heading")
Generally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class:
Copy```
classDog:

    kind = 'canine'         # class variable shared by all instances

    def__init__(self, name):
        self.name = name    # instance variable unique to each instance

>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.kind                  # shared by all dogs
'canine'
>>> e.kind                  # shared by all dogs
'canine'
>>> d.name                  # unique to d
'Fido'
>>> e.name                  # unique to e
'Buddy'

```

As discussed in [A Word About Names and Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-object), shared data can have possibly surprising effects with involving [mutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mutable) objects such as lists and dictionaries. For example, the _tricks_ list in the following code should not be used as a class variable because just a single list would be shared by all _Dog_ instances:
Copy```
classDog:

    tricks = []             # mistaken use of a class variable

    def__init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    defadd_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)

>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.add_trick('roll over')
>>> e.add_trick('play dead')
>>> d.tricks                # unexpectedly shared by all dogs
['roll over', 'play dead']

```

Correct design of the class should use an instance variable instead:
Copy```
classDog:

    def__init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tricks = []    # creates a new empty list for each dog

    defadd_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)

>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.add_trick('roll over')
>>> e.add_trick('play dead')
>>> d.tricks
['roll over']
>>> e.tricks
['play dead']

```

##  9.4. Random Remarks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#random-remarks "Link to this heading")
If the same attribute name occurs in both an instance and in a class, then attribute lookup prioritizes the instance:
Copy```
>>> classWarehouse:
...    purpose = 'storage'
...    region = 'west'
...
>>> w1 = Warehouse()
>>> print(w1.purpose, w1.region)
storage west
>>> w2 = Warehouse()
>>> w2.region = 'east'
>>> print(w2.purpose, w2.region)
storage east

```

Data attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary users (“clients”) of an object. In other words, classes are not usable to implement pure abstract data types. In fact, nothing in Python makes it possible to enforce data hiding — it is all based upon convention. (On the other hand, the Python implementation, written in C, can completely hide implementation details and control access to an object if necessary; this can be used by extensions to Python written in C.)
Clients should use data attributes with care — clients may mess up invariants maintained by the methods by stamping on their data attributes. Note that clients may add data attributes of their own to an instance object without affecting the validity of the methods, as long as name conflicts are avoided — again, a naming convention can save a lot of headaches here.
There is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other methods!) from within methods. I find that this actually increases the readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local variables and instance variables when glancing through a method.
Often, the first argument of a method is called `self`. This is nothing more than a convention: the name `self` has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a _class browser_ program might be written that relies upon such a convention.
Any function object that is a class attribute defines a method for instances of that class. It is not necessary that the function definition is textually enclosed in the class definition: assigning a function object to a local variable in the class is also ok. For example:
Copy```
# Function defined outside the class
deff1(self, x, y):
    return min(x, x+y)

classC:
    f = f1

    defg(self):
        return 'hello world'

    h = g

```

Now `f`, `g` and `h` are all attributes of class `C` that refer to function objects, and consequently they are all methods of instances of `C` — `h` being exactly equivalent to `g`. Note that this practice usually only serves to confuse the reader of a program.
Methods may call other methods by using method attributes of the `self` argument:
Copy```
classBag:
    def__init__(self):
        self.data = []

    defadd(self, x):
        self.data.append(x)

    defaddtwice(self, x):
        self.add(x)
        self.add(x)

```

Methods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary functions. The global scope associated with a method is the module containing its definition. (A class is never used as a global scope.) While one rarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a method, there are many legitimate uses of the global scope: for one thing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be used by methods, as well as functions and classes defined in it. Usually, the class containing the method is itself defined in this global scope, and in the next section we’ll find some good reasons why a method would want to reference its own class.
Each value is an object, and therefore has a _class_ (also called its _type_). It is stored as `object.__class__`.
##  9.5. Inheritance[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance "Link to this heading")
Of course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this:
Copy```
classDerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

```

The name `BaseClassName` must be defined in a namespace accessible from the scope containing the derived class definition. In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the base class is defined in another module:
Copy```
classDerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):

```

Execution of a derived class definition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is constructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class. This rule is applied recursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class.
There’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes: `DerivedClassName()` creates a new instance of the class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.
Derived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method defined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers: all methods in Python are effectively `virtual`.)
An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call `BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)`. This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that this only works if the base class is accessible as `BaseClassName` in the global scope.)
Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:
  * Use [`isinstance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") to check an instance’s type: `isinstance(obj, int)` will be `True` only if `obj.__class__` is [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") or some class derived from [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int").
  * Use [`issubclass()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#issubclass "issubclass") to check class inheritance: `issubclass(bool, int)` is `True` since [`bool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "bool") is a subclass of [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"). However, `issubclass(float, int)` is `False` since [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float") is not a subclass of [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int").


###  9.5.1. Multiple Inheritance[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance "Link to this heading")
Python supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this:
Copy```
classDerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

```

For most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent class as depth-first, left-to-right, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hierarchy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in `DerivedClassName`, it is searched for in `Base1`, then (recursively) in the base classes of `Base1`, and if it was not found there, it was searched for in `Base2`, and so on.
In fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to [`super()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super "super"). This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as call-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages.
Dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all classes inherit from [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"), so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"). To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see [The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/mro.html#python-2-3-mro).
##  9.6. Private Variables[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables "Link to this heading")
“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. `_spam`) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.
Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called _name mangling_. Any identifier of the form `__spam` (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with `_classname__spam`, where `classname` is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class.
See also
The [private name mangling specifications](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#private-name-mangling) for details and special cases.
Name mangling is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls. For example:
Copy```
classMapping:
    def__init__(self, iterable):
        self.items_list = []
        self.__update(iterable)

    defupdate(self, iterable):
        for item in iterable:
            self.items_list.append(item)

    __update = update   # private copy of original update() method

classMappingSubclass(Mapping):

    defupdate(self, keys, values):
        # provides new signature for update()
        # but does not break __init__()
        for item in zip(keys, values):
            self.items_list.append(item)

```

The above example would work even if `MappingSubclass` were to introduce a `__update` identifier since it is replaced with `_Mapping__update` in the `Mapping` class and `_MappingSubclass__update` in the `MappingSubclass` class respectively.
Note that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; it still is possible to access or modify a variable that is considered private. This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger.
Notice that code passed to `exec()` or `eval()` does not consider the classname of the invoking class to be the current class; this is similar to the effect of the `global` statement, the effect of which is likewise restricted to code that is byte-compiled together. The same restriction applies to `getattr()`, `setattr()` and `delattr()`, as well as when referencing `__dict__` directly.
##  9.7. Odds and Ends[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#odds-and-ends "Link to this heading")
Sometimes it is useful to have a data type similar to the Pascal “record” or C “struct”, bundling together a few named data items. The idiomatic approach is to use [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses "dataclasses: Generate special methods on user-defined classes.") for this purpose:
Copy```
fromdataclassesimport dataclass

@dataclass
classEmployee:
    name: str
    dept: str
    salary: int

```

Copy```
>>> john = Employee('john', 'computer lab', 1000)
>>> john.dept
'computer lab'
>>> john.salary
1000

```

A piece of Python code that expects a particular abstract data type can often be passed a class that emulates the methods of that data type instead. For instance, if you have a function that formats some data from a file object, you can define a class with methods [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.read "io.TextIOBase.read") and [`readline()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.readline "io.TextIOBase.readline") that get the data from a string buffer instead, and pass it as an argument.
[Instance method objects](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#instance-methods) have attributes, too: [`m.__self__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__self__ "method.__self__") is the instance object with the method `m()`, and [`m.__func__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#method.__func__ "method.__func__") is the [function object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-funcs) corresponding to the method.
##  9.8. Iterators[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators "Link to this heading")
By now you have probably noticed that most container objects can be looped over using a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement:
Copy```
for element in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(element)
for element in (1, 2, 3):
    print(element)
for key in {'one':1, 'two':2}:
    print(key)
for char in "123":
    print(char)
for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end='')

```

This style of access is clear, concise, and convenient. The use of iterators pervades and unifies Python. Behind the scenes, the [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement calls [`iter()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter "iter") on the container object. The function returns an iterator object that defines the method [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__ "iterator.__next__") which accesses elements in the container one at a time. When there are no more elements, [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__ "iterator.__next__") raises a [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") exception which tells the `for` loop to terminate. You can call the [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__ "iterator.__next__") method using the [`next()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next "next") built-in function; this example shows how it all works:
Copy```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> it = iter(s)
>>> it
<str_iterator object at 0x10c90e650>
>>> next(it)
'a'
>>> next(it)
'b'
>>> next(it)
'c'
>>> next(it)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
next(it)
StopIteration

```

Having seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to add iterator behavior to your classes. Define an [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#container.__iter__ "container.__iter__") method which returns an object with a [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__ "iterator.__next__") method. If the class defines `__next__()`, then `__iter__()` can just return `self`:
Copy```
classReverse:

##  9.9. Generators[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators "Link to this heading")
[Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They are written like regular functions but use the [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) statement whenever they want to return data. Each time [`next()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next "next") is called on it, the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data values and which statement was last executed). An example shows that generators can be trivially easy to create:
Copy```
defreverse(data):
    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):
        yield data[index]

```

Copy```
>>> for char in reverse('golf'):
...     print(char)
...
f
l
o
g

```

Anything that can be done with generators can also be done with class-based iterators as described in the previous section. What makes generators so compact is that the [`__iter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__iter__ "iterator.__iter__") and [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.__next__ "generator.__next__") methods are created automatically.
Another key feature is that the local variables and execution state are automatically saved between calls. This made the function easier to write and much more clear than an approach using instance variables like `self.index` and `self.data`.
In addition to automatic method creation and saving program state, when generators terminate, they automatically raise [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"). In combination, these features make it easy to create iterators with no more effort than writing a regular function.
##  9.10. Generator Expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generator-expressions "Link to this heading")
Some simple generators can be coded succinctly as expressions using a syntax similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of square brackets. These expressions are designed for situations where the generator is used right away by an enclosing function. Generator expressions are more compact but less versatile than full generator definitions and tend to be more memory friendly than equivalent list comprehensions.
Examples:
Copy```
>>> sum(i*i for i in range(10))                 # sum of squares
285

>>> xvec = [10, 20, 30]
>>> yvec = [7, 5, 3]
>>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec))         # dot product
260

>>> unique_words = set(word for line in page  for word in line.split())

>>> valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)

>>> data = 'golf'
>>> list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1))
['f', 'l', 'o', 'g']

```

Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#id1)]
Except for one thing. Module objects have a secret read-only attribute called [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") which returns the dictionary used to implement the module’s namespace; the name `__dict__` is an attribute but not a global name. Obviously, using this violates the abstraction of namespace implementation, and should be restricted to things like post-mortem debuggers.

#  2. Using the Python Interpreter[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#using-the-python-interpreter "Link to this heading")
##  2.1. Invoking the Interpreter[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#invoking-the-interpreter "Link to this heading")
The Python interpreter is usually installed as `/usr/local/bin/python3.13` on those machines where it is available; putting `/usr/local/bin` in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:
to the shell. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#id2) Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., `/usr/local/python` is a popular alternative location.)
On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the [Microsoft Store](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#windows-store), the `python3.13` command will be available. If you have the [py.exe launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) installed, you can use the `py` command. See [Excursus: Setting environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#setting-envvars) for other ways to launch Python.
Typing an end-of-file character (`Control`-`D` on Unix, `Control`-`Z` on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: `quit()`.
The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing `Control`-`P` to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix [Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.html#tut-interacting) for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if `^P` is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.
The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a _script_ from that file.
A second way of starting the interpreter is `python -c command [arg] ...`, which executes the statement(s) in _command_ , analogous to the shell’s [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote _command_ in its entirety.
Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using `python -m module [arg] ...`, which executes the source file for _module_ as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.
When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing [`-i`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-i) before the script.
All command line options are described in [Command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-general).
###  2.1.1. Argument Passing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#argument-passing "Link to this heading")
When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the `argv` variable in the `sys` module. You can access this list by executing `import sys`. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, `sys.argv[0]` is an empty string. When the script name is given as `'-'` (meaning standard input), `sys.argv[0]` is set to `'-'`. When [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) _command_ is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to `'-c'`. When [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) _module_ is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) _command_ or [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) _module_ are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in `sys.argv` for the command or module to handle.
###  2.1.2. Interactive Mode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-mode "Link to this heading")
When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in _interactive mode_. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the _primary prompt_ , usually three greater-than signs (`>>>`); for continuation lines it prompts with the _secondary prompt_ , by default three dots (`...`). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:
```
$ python3.13
Python 3.13 (default, April 4 2023, 09:25:04)
[GCC 10.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

```

Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement:
Copy```
>>> the_world_is_flat = True
>>> if the_world_is_flat:
...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
...
Be careful not to fall off!

```

For more on interactive mode, see [Interactive Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#tut-interac).
##  2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#the-interpreter-and-its-environment "Link to this heading")
###  2.2.1. Source Code Encoding[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding "Link to this heading")
By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.
To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the _first_ line of the file. The syntax is as follows:
Copy```
# -*- coding: encoding -*-

```

where _encoding_ is one of the valid [`codecs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams.") supported by Python.
For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:
Copy```
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

```

One exception to the _first line_ rule is when the source code starts with a [UNIX “shebang” line](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#tut-scripts). In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:
Copy```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

```

Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#id1)]
On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named `python`, so that it does not conflict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.

#  5. Data Structures[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#data-structures "Link to this heading")
This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.
##  5.1. More on Lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists "Link to this heading")
The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects: 

list.append(_x_) 
    
Add an item to the end of the list. Similar to `a[len(a):] = [x]`. 

list.extend(_iterable_) 
    
Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Similar to `a[len(a):] = iterable`. 

list.insert(_i_ , _x_) 
    
Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so `a.insert(0, x)` inserts at the front of the list, and `a.insert(len(a), x)` is equivalent to `a.append(x)`. 

list.remove(_x_) 
    
Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to _x_. It raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if there is no such item. 

list.pop([_i_]) 
    
Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, `a.pop()` removes and returns the last item in the list. It raises an [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError") if the list is empty or the index is outside the list range. 

list.clear() 
    
Remove all items from the list. Similar to `del a[:]`. 

list.index(_x_[, _start_[, _end_]]) 
    
Return zero-based index of the first occurrence of _x_ in the list. Raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if there is no such item.
The optional arguments _start_ and _end_ are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the _start_ argument. 

list.count(_x_) 
    
Return the number of times _x_ appears in the list. 

list.sort(_*_ , _key =None_, _reverse =False_) 
    
Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted "sorted") for their explanation). 

list.reverse() 
    
Reverse the elements of the list in place. 

list.copy() 
    
Return a shallow copy of the list. Similar to `a[:]`.
An example that uses most of the list methods:
Copy```
>>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']
>>> fruits.count('apple')
2
>>> fruits.count('tangerine')
0
>>> fruits.index('banana')
3
>>> fruits.index('banana', 4)  # Find next banana starting at position 4
6
>>> fruits.reverse()
>>> fruits
['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange']
>>> fruits.append('grape')
>>> fruits
['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape']
>>> fruits.sort()
>>> fruits
['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear']
>>> fruits.pop()
'pear'

```

You might have noticed that methods like `insert`, `remove` or `sort` that only modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default `None`. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#id2) This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python.
Another thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or compared. For instance, `[None, 'hello', 10]` doesn’t sort because integers can’t be compared to strings and `None` can’t be compared to other types. Also, there are some types that don’t have a defined ordering relation. For example, `3+4j < 5+7j` isn’t a valid comparison.
###  5.1.1. Using Lists as Stacks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacks "Link to this heading")
The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use [`append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.append "list.append"). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use [`pop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.pop "list.pop") without an explicit index. For example:
Copy```
>>> stack = [3, 4, 5]
>>> stack.append(6)
>>> stack.append(7)
>>> stack
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
>>> stack.pop()
7
>>> stack
[3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> stack.pop()
6
>>> stack.pop()
5
>>> stack
[3, 4]

```

###  5.1.2. Using Lists as Queues[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-queues "Link to this heading")
It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one).
To implement a queue, use [`collections.deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque") which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example:
Copy```
>>> fromcollectionsimport deque
>>> queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"])
>>> queue.append("Terry")           # Terry arrives
>>> queue.append("Graham")          # Graham arrives
>>> queue.popleft()                 # The first to arrive now leaves
'Eric'
>>> queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves
'John'
>>> queue                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival
deque(['Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])

```

###  5.1.3. List Comprehensions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions "Link to this heading")
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.
For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:
Copy```
>>> squares = []
>>> for x in range(10):
...     squares.append(x**2)
...
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

```

Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named `x` that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using:
Copy```
squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))

```

or, equivalently:
Copy```
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

```

which is more concise and readable.
A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the `for` and `if` clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal:
Copy```
>>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

```

and it’s equivalent to:
Copy```
>>> combs = []
>>> for x in [1,2,3]:
...     for y in [3,1,4]:
...         if x != y:
...             combs.append((x, y))
...
>>> combs
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

```

Note how the order of the [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) and [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statements is the same in both these snippets.
If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the `(x, y)` in the previous example), it must be parenthesized.
Copy```
>>> vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]
>>> # create a new list with the values doubled
>>> [x*2 for x in vec]
[-8, -4, 0, 4, 8]
>>> # filter the list to exclude negative numbers
>>> [x for x in vec if x >= 0]
[0, 2, 4]
>>> # apply a function to all the elements
>>> [abs(x) for x in vec]
[4, 2, 0, 2, 4]
>>> # call a method on each element
>>> freshfruit = ['  banana', '  loganberry ', 'passion fruit  ']
>>> [weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit]
['banana', 'loganberry', 'passion fruit']
>>> # create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)
>>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(6)]
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]
>>> # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised
>>> [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]
  File "<stdin>", line 1
[x, x**2 for x in range(6)]
^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: did you forget parentheses around the comprehension target?
>>> # flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for'
>>> vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
>>> [num for elem in vec for num in elem]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

```

List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:
Copy```
>>> frommathimport pi
>>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)]
['3.1', '3.14', '3.142', '3.1416', '3.14159']

```

###  5.1.4. Nested List Comprehensions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#nested-list-comprehensions "Link to this heading")
The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list comprehension.
Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4:
Copy```
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
...     [5, 6, 7, 8],
...     [9, 10, 11, 12],
... ]

```

The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:
Copy```
>>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

```

As we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in the context of the [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) that follows it, so this example is equivalent to:
Copy```
>>> transposed = []
>>> for i in range(4):
...     transposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix])
...
>>> transposed
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

```

which, in turn, is the same as:
Copy```
>>> transposed = []
>>> for i in range(4):
...     # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp
...     transposed_row = []
...     for row in matrix:
...         transposed_row.append(row[i])
...     transposed.append(transposed_row)
...
>>> transposed
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

```

In the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex flow statements. The [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip "zip") function would do a great job for this use case:
Copy```
>>> list(zip(*matrix))
[(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]

```

See [Unpacking Argument Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-unpacking-arguments) for details on the asterisk in this line.
##  5.2. The `del` statement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement "Link to this heading")
There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) statement. This differs from the [`pop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.pop "list.pop") method which returns a value. The `del` statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example:
Copy```
>>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[0]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[2:4]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 1234.5]
>>> del a[:]
>>> a
[]

```

[`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) can also be used to delete entire variables:
Copy```
>>> del a

```

Referencing the name `a` hereafter is an error (at least until another value is assigned to it). We’ll find other uses for [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) later.
##  5.3. Tuples and Sequences[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences "Link to this heading")
We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of _sequence_ data types (see [Sequence Types — list, tuple, range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq)). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the _tuple_.
A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:
Copy```
>>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
>>> t[0]
12345
>>> t
(12345, 54321, 'hello!')
>>> # Tuples may be nested:
>>> u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>> u
((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
>>> # Tuples are immutable:
>>> t[0] = 88888
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> # but they can contain mutable objects:
>>> v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
>>> v
([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])

```

As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists.
Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of [`namedtuples`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple "collections.namedtuple")). Lists are [mutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mutable), and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.
A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective. For example:
Copy```
>>> empty = ()
>>> singleton = 'hello',    # <-- note trailing comma
>>> len(empty)
0
>>> len(singleton)
1
>>> singleton
('hello',)

```

The statement `t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'` is an example of _tuple packing_ : the values `12345`, `54321` and `'hello!'` are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:
Copy```
>>> x, y, z = t

```

This is called, appropriately enough, _sequence unpacking_ and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.
##  5.4. Sets[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets "Link to this heading")
Python also includes a data type for _sets_. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
Curly braces or the [`set()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use `set()`, not `{}`; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.
Here is a brief demonstration:
Copy```
>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
>>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed
{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
>>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing
True
>>> 'crabgrass' in basket
False

>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
>>>
>>> a = set('abracadabra')
>>> b = set('alacazam')
>>> a                                  # unique letters in a
{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
{'r', 'd', 'b'}
>>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both
{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
{'a', 'c'}
>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}

```

Similarly to [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-listcomps), set comprehensions are also supported:
Copy```
>>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
>>> a
{'r', 'd'}

```

##  5.5. Dictionaries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries "Link to this heading")
Another useful data type built into Python is the _dictionary_ (see [Mapping Types — dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by _keys_ , which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like [`append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.append "list.append") and [`extend()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.extend "list.extend").
It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of _key: value_ pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: `{}`. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.
The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with `del`. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.
Performing `list(d)` on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use `sorted(d)` instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) keyword.
Here is a small example using a dictionary:
Copy```
>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
>>> tel['guido'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127}
>>> tel['jack']
4098
>>> del tel['sape']
>>> tel['irv'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}
>>> list(tel)
['jack', 'guido', 'irv']
>>> sorted(tel)
['guido', 'irv', 'jack']
>>> 'guido' in tel
True
>>> 'jack' not in tel
False

```

The [`dict()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:
Copy```
>>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
{'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}

```

In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions:
Copy```
>>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}
{2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}

```

When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:
Copy```
>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)
{'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}

```

##  5.6. Looping Techniques[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#looping-techniques "Link to this heading")
When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the [`items()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items "dict.items") method.
Copy```
>>> knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}
>>> for k, v in knights.items():
...     print(k, v)
...
gallahad the pure
robin the brave

```

When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the [`enumerate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate "enumerate") function.
Copy```
>>> for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
...     print(i, v)
...
0 tic
1 tac
2 toe

```

To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired with the [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip "zip") function.
Copy```
>>> questions = ['name', 'quest', 'favorite color']
>>> answers = ['lancelot', 'the holy grail', 'blue']
>>> for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
...     print('What is your {0}?  It is {1}.'.format(q, a))
...
What is your name?  It is lancelot.
What is your quest?  It is the holy grail.
What is your favorite color?  It is blue.

```

To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the [`reversed()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed "reversed") function.
Copy```
>>> for i in reversed(range(1, 10, 2)):
...     print(i)
...
9
7
5
3
1

```

To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted "sorted") function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.
Copy```
>>> basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']
>>> for i in sorted(basket):
...     print(i)
...
apple
apple
banana
orange
orange
pear

```

Using [`set()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. The use of [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted "sorted") in combination with [`set()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") over a sequence is an idiomatic way to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order.
Copy```
>>> basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']
>>> for f in sorted(set(basket)):
...     print(f)
...
apple
banana
orange
pear

```

It is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.
Copy```
>>> importmath
>>> raw_data = [56.2, float('NaN'), 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, float('NaN'), 47.8]
>>> filtered_data = []
>>> for value in raw_data:
...     if not math.isnan(value):
...         filtered_data.append(value)
...
>>> filtered_data
[56.2, 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, 47.8]

```

##  5.7. More on Conditions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-conditions "Link to this heading")
The conditions used in `while` and `if` statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons.
The comparison operators `in` and `not in` are membership tests that determine whether a value is in (or not in) a container. The operators `is` and `is not` compare whether two objects are really the same object. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators.
Comparisons can be chained. For example, `a < b == c` tests whether `a` is less than `b` and moreover `b` equals `c`.
Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators `and` and `or`, and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with `not`. These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, `not` has the highest priority and `or` the lowest, so that `A and not B or C` is equivalent to `(A and (not B)) or C`. As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition.
The Boolean operators `and` and `or` are so-called _short-circuit_ operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if `A` and `C` are true but `B` is false, `A and B and C` does not evaluate the expression `C`. When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.
It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example,
Copy```
>>> string1, string2, string3 = '', 'Trondheim', 'Hammer Dance'
>>> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3
>>> non_null
'Trondheim'

```

Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done explicitly with the [walrus operator](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-can-t-i-use-an-assignment-in-an-expression) `:=`. This avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing `=` in an expression when `==` was intended.
##  5.8. Comparing Sequences and Other Types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-types "Link to this heading")
Sequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses _lexicographical_ ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type:
Copy```
(1, 2, 3)              < (1, 2, 4)
[1, 2, 3]              < [1, 2, 4]
'ABC' < 'C' < 'Pascal' < 'Python'
(1, 2, 3, 4)           < (1, 2, 4)
(1, 2)                 < (1, 2, -1)
(1, 2, 3)             == (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
(1, 2, ('aa', 'ab'))   < (1, 2, ('abc', 'a'), 4)

```

Note that comparing objects of different types with `<` or `>` is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception.
Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#id1)]
Other languages may return the mutated object, which allows method chaining, such as `d->insert("a")->remove("b")->sort();`.

#  4. More Control Flow Tools[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-control-flow-tools "Link to this heading")
As well as the [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) statement just introduced, Python uses a few more that we will encounter in this chapter.
##  4.1. `if` Statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements "Link to this heading")
Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement. For example:
Copy```
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More

```

There can be zero or more [`elif`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#elif) parts, and the [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else) part is optional. The keyword ‘`elif`’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An `if` … `elif` … `elif` … sequence is a substitute for the `switch` or `case` statements found in other languages.
If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or attributes, you may also find the `match` statement useful. For more details see [match Statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-match).
##  4.2. `for` Statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements "Link to this heading")
The [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s `for` statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
Copy```
>>> # Measure some strings:
>>> words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12

```

Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
Copy```
# Create a sample collection
users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}

# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
for user, status in users.copy().items():
    if status == 'inactive':
        del users[user]

# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
    if status == 'active':
        active_users[user] = status

```

##  4.3. The [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") Function[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#the-range-function "Link to this heading")
If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:
Copy```
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4

```

The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; `range(10)` generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):
Copy```
>>> list(range(5, 10))
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]

>>> list(range(-10, -100, -30))
[-10, -40, -70]

```

To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") and [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") as follows:
Copy```
>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
>>> for i in range(len(a)):
...     print(i, a[i])
...
0 Mary
1 had
2 a
3 little
4 lamb

```

In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the [`enumerate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate "enumerate") function, see [Looping Techniques](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-loopidioms).
A strange thing happens if you just print a range:
Copy```
>>> range(10)
range(0, 10)

```

In many ways the object returned by [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.
We say such an object is [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable), that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that the [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement is such a construct, while an example of a function that takes an iterable is [`sum()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum "sum"):
Copy```
>>> sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3
6

```

Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as arguments. In chapter [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-structures), we will discuss in more detail about [`list()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list").
##  4.4. `break` and `continue` Statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements "Link to this heading")
The [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) statement breaks out of the innermost enclosing [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) or [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) loop:
Copy```
>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(f"{n} equals {x} * {n//x}")
...             break
...
4 equals 2 * 2
6 equals 2 * 3
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3

```

The [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement continues with the next iteration of the loop:
Copy```
>>> for num in range(2, 10):
...     if num % 2 == 0:
...         print(f"Found an even number {num}")
...         continue
...     print(f"Found an odd number {num}")
...
Found an even number 2
Found an odd number 3
Found an even number 4
Found an odd number 5
Found an even number 6
Found an odd number 7
Found an even number 8
Found an odd number 9

```

##  4.5. `else` Clauses on Loops[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#else-clauses-on-loops "Link to this heading")
In a `for` or `while` loop the `break` statement may be paired with an `else` clause. If the loop finishes without executing the `break`, the `else` clause executes.
In a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) loop, the `else` clause is executed after the loop finishes its final iteration, that is, if no break occurred.
In a [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) loop, it’s executed after the loop’s condition becomes false.
In either kind of loop, the `else` clause is **not** executed if the loop was terminated by a [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break). Of course, other ways of ending the loop early, such as a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) or a raised exception, will also skip execution of the [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else) clause.
This is exemplified in the following `for` loop, which searches for prime numbers:
Copy```
>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
...             break
...     else:
...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
...
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3

```

(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the `else` clause belongs to the `for` loop, **not** the `if` statement.)
One way to think of the else clause is to imagine it paired with the `if` inside the loop. As the loop executes, it will run a sequence like if/if/if/else. The `if` is inside the loop, encountered a number of times. If the condition is ever true, a `break` will happen. If the condition is never true, the `else` clause outside the loop will execute.
When used with a loop, the `else` clause has more in common with the `else` clause of a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement than it does with that of `if` statements: a `try` statement’s `else` clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’s `else` clause runs when no `break` occurs. For more on the `try` statement and exceptions, see [Handling Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#tut-handling).
##  4.6. `pass` Statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements "Link to this heading")
The [`pass`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#pass) statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:
Copy```
>>> while True:
...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
...

```

This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:
Copy```
>>> classMyEmptyClass:
...     pass
...

```

Another place [`pass`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#pass) can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The `pass` is silently ignored:
Copy```
>>> definitlog(*args):
...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
...

```

For this last case, many people use the ellipsis literal `...` instead of `pass`. This use has no special meaning to Python, and is not part of the language definition (you could use any constant expression here), but `...` is used conventionally as a placeholder body as well. See [The Ellipsis Object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-ellipsis-object).
##  4.7. `match` Statements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#match-statements "Link to this heading")
A [`match`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match) statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. This is superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java or JavaScript (and many other languages), but it’s more similar to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches gets executed and it can also extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.
The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:
Copy```
defhttp_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        case_:
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"

```

Note the last block: the “variable name” `_` acts as a _wildcard_ and never fails to match. If no case matches, none of the branches is executed.
You can combine several literals in a single pattern using `|` (“or”):
Copy```
case 401 | 403 | 404:
    return "Not allowed"

```

Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind variables:
Copy```
# point is an (x, y) tuple
match point:
    case (0, 0):
        print("Origin")
    case (0, y):
        print(f"Y={y}")
    case (x, 0):
        print(f"X={x}")
    case (x, y):
        print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")
    case_:
        raise ValueError("Not a point")

```

Study that one carefully! The first pattern has two literals, and can be thought of as an extension of the literal pattern shown above. But the next two patterns combine a literal and a variable, and the variable _binds_ a value from the subject (`point`). The fourth pattern captures two values, which makes it conceptually similar to the unpacking assignment `(x, y) = point`.
If you are using classes to structure your data you can use the class name followed by an argument list resembling a constructor, but with the ability to capture attributes into variables:
Copy```
classPoint:
    def__init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

defwhere_is(point):
    match point:
        case Point(x=0, y=0):
            print("Origin")
        case Point(x=0, y=y):
            print(f"Y={y}")
        case Point(x=x, y=0):
            print(f"X={x}")
        case Point():
            print("Somewhere else")
        case_:
            print("Not a point")

```

You can use positional parameters with some builtin classes that provide an ordering for their attributes (e.g. dataclasses). You can also define a specific position for attributes in patterns by setting the `__match_args__` special attribute in your classes. If it’s set to (“x”, “y”), the following patterns are all equivalent (and all bind the `y` attribute to the `var` variable):
Copy```
Point(1, var)
Point(1, y=var)
Point(x=1, y=var)
Point(y=var, x=1)

```

A recommended way to read patterns is to look at them as an extended form of what you would put on the left of an assignment, to understand which variables would be set to what. Only the standalone names (like `var` above) are assigned to by a match statement. Dotted names (like `foo.bar`), attribute names (the `x=` and `y=` above) or class names (recognized by the “(…)” next to them like `Point` above) are never assigned to.
Patterns can be arbitrarily nested. For example, if we have a short list of Points, with `__match_args__` added, we could match it like this:
Copy```
classPoint:
    __match_args__ = ('x', 'y')
    def__init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

match points:
    case []:
        print("No points")
    case [Point(0, 0)]:
        print("The origin")
    case [Point(x, y)]:
        print(f"Single point {x}, {y}")
    case [Point(0, y1), Point(0, y2)]:
        print(f"Two on the Y axis at {y1}, {y2}")
    case_:
        print("Something else")

```

We can add an `if` clause to a pattern, known as a “guard”. If the guard is false, `match` goes on to try the next case block. Note that value capture happens before the guard is evaluated:
Copy```
match point:
    case Point(x, y) if x == y:
        print(f"Y=X at {x}")
    case Point(x, y):
        print(f"Not on the diagonal")

```

Several other key features of this statement:
  * Like unpacking assignments, tuple and list patterns have exactly the same meaning and actually match arbitrary sequences. An important exception is that they don’t match iterators or strings.
  * Sequence patterns support extended unpacking: `[x, y, *rest]` and `(x, y, *rest)` work similar to unpacking assignments. The name after `*` may also be `_`, so `(x, y, *_)` matches a sequence of at least two items without binding the remaining items.
  * Mapping patterns: `{"bandwidth": b, "latency": l}` captures the `"bandwidth"` and `"latency"` values from a dictionary. Unlike sequence patterns, extra keys are ignored. An unpacking like `**rest` is also supported. (But `**_` would be redundant, so it is not allowed.)
  * Subpatterns may be captured using the `as` keyword:
Copy```
case (Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2) as p2): ...

```

will capture the second element of the input as `p2` (as long as the input is a sequence of two points)
  * Most literals are compared by equality, however the singletons `True`, `False` and `None` are compared by identity.
  * Patterns may use named constants. These must be dotted names to prevent them from being interpreted as capture variable:
Copy```
fromenumimport Enum
classColor(Enum):
    RED = 'red'
    GREEN = 'green'
    BLUE = 'blue'

color = Color(input("Enter your choice of 'red', 'blue' or 'green': "))

match color:
    case Color.RED:
        print("I see red!")
    case Color.GREEN:
        print("Grass is green")
    case Color.BLUE:
        print("I'm feeling the blues :(")

```



For a more detailed explanation and additional examples, you can look into [**PEP 636**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/) which is written in a tutorial format.
##  4.8. Defining Functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions "Link to this heading")
We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:
Copy```
>>> deffib(n):    # write Fibonacci series less than n
... """Print a Fibonacci series less than n."""
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         print(a, end=' ')
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     print()
...
>>> # Now call the function we just defined:
>>> fib(2000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597

```

The keyword [`def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#def) introduces a function _definition_. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.
The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or _docstring_. (More about docstrings can be found in the section [Documentation Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-docstrings).) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.
The _execution_ of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) statement), although they may be referenced.
The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using _call by value_ (where the _value_ is always an object _reference_ , not the value of the object). [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#id2) When a function calls another function, or calls itself recursively, a new local symbol table is created for that call.
A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table. The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by that name as a user-defined function. Other names can also point to that same function object and can also be used to access the function:
Copy```
>>> fib
<function fib at 10042ed0>
>>> f = fib
>>> f(100)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89

```

Coming from other languages, you might object that `fib` is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. In fact, even functions without a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called `None` (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value `None` is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print"):
Copy```
>>> fib(0)
>>> print(fib(0))
None

```

It is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of printing it:
Copy```
>>> deffib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n
... """Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     result = []
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         result.append(a)    # see below
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     return result
...
>>> f100 = fib2(100)    # call it
>>> f100                # write the result
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

```

This example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:
  * The [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) statement returns with a value from a function. `return` without an expression argument returns `None`. Falling off the end of a function also returns `None`.
  * The statement `result.append(a)` calls a _method_ of the list object `result`. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named `obj.methodname`, where `obj` is some object (this may be an expression), and `methodname` is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to define your own object types and methods, using _classes_ , see [Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes)) The method [`append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.append "list.append") shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to `result = result + [a]`, but more efficient.


##  4.9. More on Defining Functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions "Link to this heading")
It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms, which can be combined.
###  4.9.1. Default Argument Values[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values "Link to this heading")
The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow. For example:
Copy```
defask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):
    while True:
        reply = input(prompt)
        if reply in {'y', 'ye', 'yes'}:
            return True
        if reply in {'n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'}:
            return False
        retries = retries - 1
        if retries < 0:
            raise ValueError('invalid user response')
        print(reminder)

```

This function can be called in several ways:
  * giving only the mandatory argument: `ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')`
  * giving one of the optional arguments: `ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)`
  * or even giving all arguments: `ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')`


This example also introduces the [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) keyword. This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.
The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the _defining_ scope, so that
Copy```
i = 5

deff(arg=i):
    print(arg)

i = 6
f()

```

will print `5`.
**Important warning:** The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:
Copy```
deff(a, L=[]):
    L.append(a)
    return L

print(f(1))
print(f(2))
print(f(3))

```

This will print
Copy```
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]

```

If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:
Copy```
deff(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L

```

###  4.9.2. Keyword Arguments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments "Link to this heading")
Functions can also be called using [keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-keyword-argument) of the form `kwarg=value`. For instance, the following function:
Copy```
defparrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):
    print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
    print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.")
    print("-- Lovely plumage, the", type)
    print("-- It's", state, "!")

```

accepts one required argument (`voltage`) and three optional arguments (`state`, `action`, and `type`). This function can be called in any of the following ways:
Copy```
parrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument
parrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument
parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments
parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword

```

but all the following calls would be invalid:
Copy```
parrot()                     # required argument missing
parrot(voltage=5.0, 'dead')  # non-keyword argument after a keyword argument
parrot(110, voltage=220)     # duplicate value for the same argument
parrot(actor='John Cleese')  # unknown keyword argument

```

In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function (e.g. `actor` is not a valid argument for the `parrot` function), and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments (e.g. `parrot(voltage=1000)` is valid too). No argument may receive a value more than once. Here’s an example that fails due to this restriction:
Copy```
>>> deffunction(a):
...     pass
...
>>> function(0, a=0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: function() got multiple values for argument 'a'

```

When a final formal parameter of the form `**name` is present, it receives a dictionary (see [Mapping Types — dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)) containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form `*name` (described in the next subsection) which receives a [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-tuples) containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (`*name` must occur before `**name`.) For example, if we define a function like this:
Copy```
defcheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):
    print("-- Do you have any", kind, "?")
    print("-- I'm sorry, we're all out of", kind)
    for arg in arguments:
        print(arg)
    print("-" * 40)
    for kw in keywords:
        print(kw, ":", keywords[kw])

```

It could be called like this:
Copy```
cheeseshop("Limburger", "It's very runny, sir.",
           "It's really very, VERY runny, sir.",
           shopkeeper="Michael Palin",
           client="John Cleese",
           sketch="Cheese Shop Sketch")

```

and of course it would print:
Note that the order in which the keyword arguments are printed is guaranteed to match the order in which they were provided in the function call.
###  4.9.3. Special parameters[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#special-parameters "Link to this heading")
By default, arguments may be passed to a Python function either by position or explicitly by keyword. For readability and performance, it makes sense to restrict the way arguments can be passed so that a developer need only look at the function definition to determine if items are passed by position, by position or keyword, or by keyword.
A function definition may look like:
where `/` and `*` are optional. If used, these symbols indicate the kind of parameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function: positional-only, positional-or-keyword, and keyword-only. Keyword parameters are also referred to as named parameters.
####  4.9.3.1. Positional-or-Keyword Arguments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#positional-or-keyword-arguments "Link to this heading")
If `/` and `*` are not present in the function definition, arguments may be passed to a function by position or by keyword.
####  4.9.3.2. Positional-Only Parameters[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#positional-only-parameters "Link to this heading")
Looking at this in a bit more detail, it is possible to mark certain parameters as _positional-only_. If _positional-only_ , the parameters’ order matters, and the parameters cannot be passed by keyword. Positional-only parameters are placed before a `/` (forward-slash). The `/` is used to logically separate the positional-only parameters from the rest of the parameters. If there is no `/` in the function definition, there are no positional-only parameters.
Parameters following the `/` may be _positional-or-keyword_ or _keyword-only_.
####  4.9.3.3. Keyword-Only Arguments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-only-arguments "Link to this heading")
To mark parameters as _keyword-only_ , indicating the parameters must be passed by keyword argument, place an `*` in the arguments list just before the first _keyword-only_ parameter.
####  4.9.3.4. Function Examples[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#function-examples "Link to this heading")
Consider the following example function definitions paying close attention to the markers `/` and `*`:
Copy```
>>> defstandard_arg(arg):
...     print(arg)
...
>>> defpos_only_arg(arg, /):
...     print(arg)
...
>>> defkwd_only_arg(*, arg):
...     print(arg)
...
>>> defcombined_example(pos_only, /, standard, *, kwd_only):
...     print(pos_only, standard, kwd_only)

```

The first function definition, `standard_arg`, the most familiar form, places no restrictions on the calling convention and arguments may be passed by position or keyword:
Copy```
>>> standard_arg(2)
2

>>> standard_arg(arg=2)
2

```

The second function `pos_only_arg` is restricted to only use positional parameters as there is a `/` in the function definition:
Copy```
>>> pos_only_arg(1)
1

>>> pos_only_arg(arg=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: pos_only_arg() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'arg'

```

The third function `kwd_only_arg` only allows keyword arguments as indicated by a `*` in the function definition:
Copy```
>>> kwd_only_arg(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: kwd_only_arg() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given

>>> kwd_only_arg(arg=3)
3

```

And the last uses all three calling conventions in the same function definition:
Copy```
>>> combined_example(1, 2, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: combined_example() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

>>> combined_example(1, 2, kwd_only=3)
1 2 3

>>> combined_example(1, standard=2, kwd_only=3)
1 2 3

>>> combined_example(pos_only=1, standard=2, kwd_only=3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: combined_example() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'pos_only'

```

Finally, consider this function definition which has a potential collision between the positional argument `name` and `**kwds` which has `name` as a key:
Copy```
deffoo(name, **kwds):
    return 'name' in kwds

```

There is no possible call that will make it return `True` as the keyword `'name'` will always bind to the first parameter. For example:
Copy```
>>> foo(1, **{'name': 2})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: foo() got multiple values for argument 'name'
>>>

```

But using `/` (positional only arguments), it is possible since it allows `name` as a positional argument and `'name'` as a key in the keyword arguments:
Copy```
>>> deffoo(name, /, **kwds):
...     return 'name' in kwds
...
>>> foo(1, **{'name': 2})
True

```

In other words, the names of positional-only parameters can be used in `**kwds` without ambiguity.
####  4.9.3.5. Recap[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#recap "Link to this heading")
The use case will determine which parameters to use in the function definition:
Copy```
deff(pos1, pos2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd1, kwd2):

```

As guidance:
  * Use positional-only if you want the name of the parameters to not be available to the user. This is useful when parameter names have no real meaning, if you want to enforce the order of the arguments when the function is called or if you need to take some positional parameters and arbitrary keywords.
  * Use keyword-only when names have meaning and the function definition is more understandable by being explicit with names or you want to prevent users relying on the position of the argument being passed.
  * For an API, use positional-only to prevent breaking API changes if the parameter’s name is modified in the future.


###  4.9.4. Arbitrary Argument Lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists "Link to this heading")
Finally, the least frequently used option is to specify that a function can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments. These arguments will be wrapped up in a tuple (see [Tuples and Sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-tuples)). Before the variable number of arguments, zero or more normal arguments may occur.
Copy```
defwrite_multiple_items(file, separator, *args):
    file.write(separator.join(args))

```

Normally, these _variadic_ arguments will be last in the list of formal parameters, because they scoop up all remaining input arguments that are passed to the function. Any formal parameters which occur after the `*args` parameter are ‘keyword-only’ arguments, meaning that they can only be used as keywords rather than positional arguments.
Copy```
>>> defconcat(*args, sep="/"):
...     return sep.join(args)
...
>>> concat("earth", "mars", "venus")
'earth/mars/venus'
>>> concat("earth", "mars", "venus", sep=".")
'earth.mars.venus'

```

###  4.9.5. Unpacking Argument Lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists "Link to this heading")
The reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a list or tuple but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments. For instance, the built-in [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") function expects separate _start_ and _stop_ arguments. If they are not available separately, write the function call with the `*`-operator to unpack the arguments out of a list or tuple:
Copy```
>>> list(range(3, 6))            # normal call with separate arguments
[3, 4, 5]
>>> args = [3, 6]
>>> list(range(*args))            # call with arguments unpacked from a list
[3, 4, 5]

```

In the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the `**`-operator:
Copy```
>>> defparrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom'):
...     print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
...     print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.", end=' ')
...     print("E's", state, "!")
...
>>> d = {"voltage": "four million", "state": "bleedin' demised", "action": "VOOM"}
>>> parrot(**d)
-- This parrot wouldn't VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E's bleedin' demised !

```

###  4.9.6. Lambda Expressions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions "Link to this heading")
Small anonymous functions can be created with the [`lambda`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) keyword. This function returns the sum of its two arguments: `lambda a, b: a+b`. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:
Copy```
>>> defmake_incrementor(n):
...     return lambda x: x + n
...
>>> f = make_incrementor(42)
>>> f(0)
42
>>> f(1)
43

```

The above example uses a lambda expression to return a function. Another use is to pass a small function as an argument. For instance, [`list.sort()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort "list.sort") takes a sorting key function _key_ which can be a lambda function:
Copy```
>>> pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]
>>> pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])
>>> pairs
[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]

```

###  4.9.7. Documentation Strings[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#documentation-strings "Link to this heading")
Here are some conventions about the content and formatting of documentation strings.
The first line should always be a short, concise summary of the object’s purpose. For brevity, it should not explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
If there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the object’s calling conventions, its side effects, etc.
The Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process documentation have to strip indentation if desired. This is done using the following convention. The first non-blank line _after_ the first line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire documentation string. (We can’t use the first line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).
Here is an example of a multi-line docstring:
Copy```
>>> defmy_function():
... """Do nothing, but document it.
...
...     No, really, it doesn't do anything.
...     """
...     pass
...
>>> print(my_function.__doc__)
Do nothing, but document it.

No, really, it doesn't do anything.

```

###  4.9.8. Function Annotations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#function-annotations "Link to this heading")
[Function annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function) are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-defined functions (see [**PEP 3107**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/) and [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) for more information).
[Annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-function-annotation) are stored in the `__annotations__` attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no effect on any other part of the function. Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation. Return annotations are defined by a literal `->`, followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the [`def`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#def) statement. The following example has a required argument, an optional argument, and the return value annotated:
Copy```
>>> deff(ham: str, eggs: str = 'eggs') -> str:
...     print("Annotations:", f.__annotations__)
...     print("Arguments:", ham, eggs)
...     return ham + ' and ' + eggs
...
>>> f('spam')
Annotations: {'ham': <class 'str'>, 'return': <class 'str'>, 'eggs': <class 'str'>}
Arguments: spam eggs
'spam and eggs'

```

##  4.10. Intermezzo: Coding Style[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#intermezzo-coding-style "Link to this heading")
Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about _coding style_. Most languages can be written (or more concise, _formatted_) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.
For Python, [**PEP 8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:
  * Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.
4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.
  * Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.
This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.
  * Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
  * When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
  * Use docstrings.
  * Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.
  * Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and `lowercase_with_underscores` for functions and methods. Always use `self` as the name for the first method argument (see [A First Look at Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-firstclasses) for more on classes and methods).
  * Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.
  * Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.

#  15. Floating-Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#floating-point-arithmetic-issues-and-limitations "Link to this heading")
Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions. For example, the **decimal** fraction `0.625` has value 6/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the **binary** fraction `0.101` has value 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical values, the only real difference being that the first is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.
Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal floating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine.
The problem is easier to understand at first in base 10. Consider the fraction 1/3. You can approximate that as a base 10 fraction:
Copy```
0.3

```

or, better,
Copy```
0.33

```

or, better,
Copy```
0.333

```

and so on. No matter how many digits you’re willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3, but will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.
In the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you’re willing to use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the infinitely repeating fraction
Copy```
0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011...

```

Stop at any finite number of bits, and you get an approximation. On most machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the binary fraction is `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` which is close to but not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10.
Many users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine. On most machines, if Python were to print the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1, it would have to display:
Copy```
>>> 0.1
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625

```

That is more digits than most people find useful, so Python keeps the number of digits manageable by displaying a rounded value instead:
Copy```
>>> 1 / 10
0.1

```

Just remember, even though the printed result looks like the exact value of 1/10, the actual stored value is the nearest representable binary fraction.
Interestingly, there are many different decimal numbers that share the same nearest approximate binary fraction. For example, the numbers `0.1` and `0.10000000000000001` and `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625` are all approximated by `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55`. Since all of these decimal values share the same approximation, any one of them could be displayed while still preserving the invariant `eval(repr(x)) == x`.
Historically, the Python prompt and built-in [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") function would choose the one with 17 significant digits, `0.10000000000000001`. Starting with Python 3.1, Python (on most systems) is now able to choose the shortest of these and simply display `0.1`.
Note that this is in the very nature of binary floating point: this is not a bug in Python, and it is not a bug in your code either. You’ll see the same kind of thing in all languages that support your hardware’s floating-point arithmetic (although some languages may not _display_ the difference by default, or in all output modes).
For more pleasant output, you may wish to use string formatting to produce a limited number of significant digits:
Copy```
>>> format(math.pi, '.12g')  # give 12 significant digits
'3.14159265359'

>>> format(math.pi, '.2f')   # give 2 digits after the point
'3.14'

>>> repr(math.pi)
'3.141592653589793'

```

It’s important to realize that this is, in a real sense, an illusion: you’re simply rounding the _display_ of the true machine value.
One illusion may beget another. For example, since 0.1 is not exactly 1/10, summing three values of 0.1 may not yield exactly 0.3, either:
Copy```
>>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3
False

```

Also, since the 0.1 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 1/10 and 0.3 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 3/10, then pre-rounding with [`round()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round "round") function cannot help:
Copy```
>>> round(0.1, 1) + round(0.1, 1) + round(0.1, 1) == round(0.3, 1)
False

```

Though the numbers cannot be made closer to their intended exact values, the [`math.isclose()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose "math.isclose") function can be useful for comparing inexact values:
Copy```
>>> math.isclose(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1, 0.3)
True

```

Alternatively, the [`round()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round "round") function can be used to compare rough approximations:
Copy```
>>> round(math.pi, ndigits=2) == round(22 / 7, ndigits=2)
True

```

Binary floating-point arithmetic holds many surprises like this. The problem with “0.1” is explained in precise detail below, in the “Representation Error” section. See [Examples of Floating Point Problems](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/) for a pleasant summary of how binary floating point works and the kinds of problems commonly encountered in practice. Also see [The Perils of Floating Point](http://www.indowsway.com/floatingpoint.htm) for a more complete account of other common surprises.
As that says near the end, “there are no easy answers.” Still, don’t be unduly wary of floating point! The errors in Python float operations are inherited from the floating-point hardware, and on most machines are on the order of no more than 1 part in 2**53 per operation. That’s more than adequate for most tasks, but you do need to keep in mind that it’s not decimal arithmetic and that every float operation can suffer a new rounding error.
While pathological cases do exist, for most casual use of floating-point arithmetic you’ll see the result you expect in the end if you simply round the display of your final results to the number of decimal digits you expect. [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") usually suffices, and for finer control see the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method’s format specifiers in [Format String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings).
For use cases which require exact decimal representation, try using the [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.") module which implements decimal arithmetic suitable for accounting applications and high-precision applications.
Another form of exact arithmetic is supported by the [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#module-fractions "fractions: Rational numbers.") module which implements arithmetic based on rational numbers (so the numbers like 1/3 can be represented exactly).
If you are a heavy user of floating-point operations you should take a look at the NumPy package and many other packages for mathematical and statistical operations supplied by the SciPy project. See <<https://scipy.org>>.
Python provides tools that may help on those rare occasions when you really _do_ want to know the exact value of a float. The [`float.as_integer_ratio()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#float.as_integer_ratio "float.as_integer_ratio") method expresses the value of a float as a fraction:
Copy```
>>> x = 3.14159
>>> x.as_integer_ratio()
(3537115888337719, 1125899906842624)

```

Since the ratio is exact, it can be used to losslessly recreate the original value:
Copy```
>>> x == 3537115888337719 / 1125899906842624
True

```

The [`float.hex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#float.hex "float.hex") method expresses a float in hexadecimal (base 16), again giving the exact value stored by your computer:
Copy```
>>> x.hex()
'0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1'

```

This precise hexadecimal representation can be used to reconstruct the float value exactly:
Copy```
>>> x == float.fromhex('0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1')
True

```

Since the representation is exact, it is useful for reliably porting values across different versions of Python (platform independence) and exchanging data with other languages that support the same format (such as Java and C99).
Another helpful tool is the [`sum()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum "sum") function which helps mitigate loss-of-precision during summation. It uses extended precision for intermediate rounding steps as values are added onto a running total. That can make a difference in overall accuracy so that the errors do not accumulate to the point where they affect the final total:
Copy```
>>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 1.0
False
>>> sum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0
True

```

The [`math.fsum()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.fsum "math.fsum") goes further and tracks all of the “lost digits” as values are added onto a running total so that the result has only a single rounding. This is slower than [`sum()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum "sum") but will be more accurate in uncommon cases where large magnitude inputs mostly cancel each other out leaving a final sum near zero:
Copy```
>>> arr = [-0.10430216751806065, -266310978.67179024, 143401161448607.16,
...        -143401161400469.7, 266262841.31058735, -0.003244936839808227]
>>> float(sum(map(Fraction, arr)))   # Exact summation with single rounding
8.042173697819788e-13
>>> math.fsum(arr)                   # Single rounding
8.042173697819788e-13
>>> sum(arr)                         # Multiple roundings in extended precision
8.042178034628478e-13
>>> total = 0.0
>>> for x in arr:
...     total += x                   # Multiple roundings in standard precision
...
>>> total                            # Straight addition has no correct digits!
-0.0051575902860057365

```

##  15.1. Representation Error[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#representation-error "Link to this heading")
This section explains the “0.1” example in detail, and shows how you can perform an exact analysis of cases like this yourself. Basic familiarity with binary floating-point representation is assumed.
_Representation error_ refers to the fact that some (most, actually) decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary (base 2) fractions. This is the chief reason why Python (or Perl, C, C++, Java, Fortran, and many others) often won’t display the exact decimal number you expect.
Why is that? 1/10 is not exactly representable as a binary fraction. Since at least 2000, almost all machines use IEEE 754 binary floating-point arithmetic, and almost all platforms map Python floats to IEEE 754 binary64 “double precision” values. IEEE 754 binary64 values contain 53 bits of precision, so on input the computer strives to convert 0.1 to the closest fraction it can of the form _J_ /2**_N_ where _J_ is an integer containing exactly 53 bits. Rewriting
Copy```
1 / 10 ~= J / (2**N)

```

as
Copy```
J ~= 2**N / 10

```

and recalling that _J_ has exactly 53 bits (is `>= 2**52` but `< 2**53`), the best value for _N_ is 56:
Copy```
>>> 2**52 <=  2**56 // 10  < 2**53
True

```

That is, 56 is the only value for _N_ that leaves _J_ with exactly 53 bits. The best possible value for _J_ is then that quotient rounded:
Copy```
>>> q, r = divmod(2**56, 10)
>>> r
6

```

Since the remainder is more than half of 10, the best approximation is obtained by rounding up:
Copy```
>>> q+1
7205759403792794

```

Therefore the best possible approximation to 1/10 in IEEE 754 double precision is:
Copy```
7205759403792794 / 2 ** 56

```

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by two reduces the fraction to:
Copy```
3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55

```

Note that since we rounded up, this is actually a little bit larger than 1/10; if we had not rounded up, the quotient would have been a little bit smaller than 1/10. But in no case can it be _exactly_ 1/10!
So the computer never “sees” 1/10: what it sees is the exact fraction given above, the best IEEE 754 double approximation it can get:
Copy```
>>> 0.1 * 2 ** 55
3602879701896397.0

```

If we multiply that fraction by 10**55, we can see the value out to 55 decimal digits:
Copy```
>>> 3602879701896397 * 10 ** 55 // 2 ** 55
1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625

```

meaning that the exact number stored in the computer is equal to the decimal value 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. Instead of displaying the full decimal value, many languages (including older versions of Python), round the result to 17 significant digits:
Copy```
>>> format(0.1, '.17f')

#  7. Input and Output[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#input-and-output "Link to this heading")
There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.
##  7.1. Fancier Output Formatting[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting "Link to this heading")
So far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: _expression statements_ and the [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print") function. (A third way is using the [`write()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write "io.TextIOBase.write") method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as `sys.stdout`. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)
Often you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format output.
  * To use [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings), begin a string with `f` or `F` before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between `{` and `}` characters that can refer to variables or literal values.
Copy```
>>> year = 2016
>>> event = 'Referendum'
>>> f'Results of the {year}{event}'
'Results of the 2016 Referendum'

```

  * The [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method of strings requires more manual effort. You’ll still use `{` and `}` to mark where a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need to provide the information to be formatted. In the following code block there are two examples of how to format variables:
Copy```
>>> yes_votes = 42_572_654
>>> total_votes = 85_705_149
>>> percentage = yes_votes / total_votes
>>> '{:-9} YES votes  {:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)
' 42572654 YES votes  49.67%'

```

Notice how the `yes_votes` are padded with spaces and a negative sign only for negative numbers. The example also prints `percentage` multiplied by 100, with 2 decimal places and followed by a percent sign (see [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) for details).
  * Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation operations to create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform useful operations for padding strings to a given column width.


When you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes, you can convert any value to a string with the [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") or [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") functions.
The [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human consumption, [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") will return the same value as [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr"). Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct representations.
Some examples:
Copy```
>>> s = 'Hello, world.'
>>> str(s)
'Hello, world.'
>>> repr(s)
"'Hello, world.'"
>>> str(1/7)
'0.14285714285714285'
>>> x = 10 * 3.25
>>> y = 200 * 200
>>> s = 'The value of x is ' + repr(x) + ', and y is ' + repr(y) + '...'
>>> print(s)
The value of x is 32.5, and y is 40000...
>>> # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes:
>>> hello = 'hello, world\n'
>>> hellos = repr(hello)
>>> print(hellos)
'hello, world\n'
>>> # The argument to repr() may be any Python object:
>>> repr((x, y, ('spam', 'eggs')))
"(32.5, 40000, ('spam', 'eggs'))"

```

The [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations.") module contains a [`Template`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template "string.Template") class that offers yet another way to substitute values into strings, using placeholders like `$x` and replacing them with values from a dictionary, but offers much less control of the formatting.
###  7.1.1. Formatted String Literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals "Link to this heading")
[Formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) (also called f-strings for short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by prefixing the string with `f` or `F` and writing expressions as `{expression}`.
An optional format specifier can follow the expression. This allows greater control over how the value is formatted. The following example rounds pi to three places after the decimal:
Copy```
>>> importmath
>>> print(f'The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.')
The value of pi is approximately 3.142.

```

Passing an integer after the `':'` will cause that field to be a minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up.
Copy```
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 7678}
>>> for name, phone in table.items():
...     print(f'{name:10} ==> {phone:10d}')
...
Sjoerd     ==>       4127
Jack       ==>       4098
Dcab       ==>       7678

```

Other modifiers can be used to convert the value before it is formatted. `'!a'` applies [`ascii()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ascii "ascii"), `'!s'` applies [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str"), and `'!r'` applies [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr"):
Copy```
>>> animals = 'eels'
>>> print(f'My hovercraft is full of {animals}.')
My hovercraft is full of eels.
>>> print(f'My hovercraft is full of {animals!r}.')
My hovercraft is full of 'eels'.

```

The `=` specifier can be used to expand an expression to the text of the expression, an equal sign, then the representation of the evaluated expression:
Copy```
>>> bugs = 'roaches'
>>> count = 13
>>> area = 'living room'
>>> print(f'Debugging {bugs=}{count=}{area=}')
Debugging bugs='roaches' count=13 area='living room'

```

See [self-documenting expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#bpo-36817-whatsnew) for more information on the `=` specifier. For a reference on these format specifications, see the reference guide for the [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec).
###  7.1.2. The String format() Method[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#the-string-format-method "Link to this heading")
Basic usage of the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method looks like this:
Copy```
>>> print('We are the {} who say "{}!"'.format('knights', 'Ni'))
We are the knights who say "Ni!"

```

The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are replaced with the objects passed into the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method. A number in the brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object passed into the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method.
Copy```
>>> print('{0} and {1}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
spam and eggs
>>> print('{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
eggs and spam

```

If keyword arguments are used in the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method, their values are referred to by using the name of the argument.
Copy```
>>> print('This {food} is {adjective}.'.format(
...       food='spam', adjective='absolutely horrible'))
This spam is absolutely horrible.

```

Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined:
Copy```
>>> print('The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}.'.format('Bill', 'Manfred',
...                                                    other='Georg'))
The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg.

```

If you have a really long format string that you don’t want to split up, it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets `'[]'` to access the keys.
Copy```
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print('Jack: {0[Jack]:d}; Sjoerd: {0[Sjoerd]:d}; '
...       'Dcab: {0[Dcab]:d}'.format(table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678

```

This could also be done by passing the `table` dictionary as keyword arguments with the `**` notation.
Copy```
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print('Jack: {Jack:d}; Sjoerd: {Sjoerd:d}; Dcab: {Dcab:d}'.format(**table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678

```

This is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function [`vars()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars "vars"), which returns a dictionary containing all local variables:
Copy```
>>> table = {k: str(v) for k, v in vars().items()}
>>> message = " ".join([f'{k}: ' + '{' + k +'};' for k in table.keys()])
>>> print(message.format(**table))
__name__: __main__; __doc__: None; __package__: None; __loader__: ...

```

As an example, the following lines produce a tidily aligned set of columns giving integers and their squares and cubes:
Copy```
>>> for x in range(1, 11):
...     print('{0:2d}{1:3d}{2:4d}'.format(x, x*x, x*x*x))
...
 1   1    1
 2   4    8
 3   9   27
 4  16   64
 5  25  125
 6  36  216
 7  49  343
 8  64  512
 9  81  729
10 100 1000

```

For a complete overview of string formatting with [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format"), see [Format String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings).
###  7.1.3. Manual String Formatting[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#manual-string-formatting "Link to this heading")
Here’s the same table of squares and cubes, formatted manually:
Copy```
>>> for x in range(1, 11):
...     print(repr(x).rjust(2), repr(x*x).rjust(3), end=' ')
...     # Note use of 'end' on previous line
...     print(repr(x*x*x).rjust(4))
...
 1   1    1
 2   4    8
 3   9   27
 4  16   64
 5  25  125
 6  36  216
 7  49  343
 8  64  512
 9  81  729
10 100 1000

```

(Note that the one space between each column was added by the way [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print") works: it always adds spaces between its arguments.)
The [`str.rjust()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rjust "str.rjust") method of string objects right-justifies a string in a field of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods [`str.ljust()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.ljust "str.ljust") and [`str.center()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.center "str.center"). These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don’t truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up your column lay-out but that’s usually better than the alternative, which would be lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you can always add a slice operation, as in `x.ljust(n)[:n]`.)
There is another method, [`str.zfill()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.zfill "str.zfill"), which pads a numeric string on the left with zeros. It understands about plus and minus signs:
Copy```
>>> '12'.zfill(5)
'00012'
>>> '-3.14'.zfill(7)
'-003.14'
>>> '3.14159265359'.zfill(5)
'3.14159265359'

```

###  7.1.4. Old string formatting[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#old-string-formatting "Link to this heading")
The % operator (modulo) can also be used for string formatting. Given `format % values` (where _format_ is a string), `%` conversion specifications in _format_ are replaced with zero or more elements of _values_. This operation is commonly known as string interpolation. For example:
Copy```
>>> importmath
>>> print('The value of pi is approximately %5.3f.' % math.pi)
The value of pi is approximately 3.142.

```

More information can be found in the [printf-style String Formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting) section.
##  7.2. Reading and Writing Files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files "Link to this heading")
[`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") returns a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object), and is most commonly used with two positional arguments and one keyword argument: `open(filename, mode, encoding=None)`
Copy```
>>> f = open('workfile', 'w', encoding="utf-8")

```

The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. _mode_ can be `'r'` when the file will only be read, `'w'` for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and `'a'` opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. `'r+'` opens the file for both reading and writing. The _mode_ argument is optional; `'r'` will be assumed if it’s omitted.
Normally, files are opened in _text mode_ , that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific _encoding_. If _encoding_ is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open")). Because UTF-8 is the modern de-facto standard, `encoding="utf-8"` is recommended unless you know that you need to use a different encoding. Appending a `'b'` to the mode opens the file in _binary mode_. Binary mode data is read and written as [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") objects. You can not specify _encoding_ when opening file in binary mode.
In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (`\n` on Unix, `\r\n` on Windows) to just `\n`. When writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of `\n` back to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data like that in `JPEG` or `EXE` files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files.
It is good practice to use the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using `with` is also much shorter than writing equivalent [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)-[`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) blocks:
Copy```
>>> with open('workfile', encoding="utf-8") as f:
...     read_data = f.read()

>>> # We can check that the file has been automatically closed.
>>> f.closed
True

```

If you’re not using the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) keyword, then you should call `f.close()` to close the file and immediately free up any system resources used by it.
Warning
Calling `f.write()` without using the `with` keyword or calling `f.close()` **might** result in the arguments of `f.write()` not being completely written to the disk, even if the program exits successfully.
After a file object is closed, either by a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement or by calling `f.close()`, attempts to use the file object will automatically fail.
Copy```
>>> f.close()
>>> f.read()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.

```

###  7.2.1. Methods of File Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects "Link to this heading")
The rest of the examples in this section will assume that a file object called `f` has already been created.
To read a file’s contents, call `f.read(size)`, which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). _size_ is an optional numeric argument. When _size_ is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most _size_ characters (in text mode) or _size_ bytes (in binary mode) are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, `f.read()` will return an empty string (`''`).
Copy```
>>> f.read()
'This is the entire file.\n'
>>> f.read()
''

```

`f.readline()` reads a single line from the file; a newline character (`\n`) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn’t end in a newline. This makes the return value unambiguous; if `f.readline()` returns an empty string, the end of the file has been reached, while a blank line is represented by `'\n'`, a string containing only a single newline.
Copy```
>>> f.readline()
'This is the first line of the file.\n'
>>> f.readline()
'Second line of the file\n'
>>> f.readline()
''

```

For reading lines from a file, you can loop over the file object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code:
Copy```
>>> for line in f:
...     print(line, end='')
...
This is the first line of the file.
Second line of the file

```

If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use `list(f)` or `f.readlines()`.
`f.write(string)` writes the contents of _string_ to the file, returning the number of characters written.
Copy```
>>> f.write('This is a test\n')
15

```

Other types of objects need to be converted – either to a string (in text mode) or a bytes object (in binary mode) – before writing them:
Copy```
>>> value = ('the answer', 42)
>>> s = str(value)  # convert the tuple to string
>>> f.write(s)
18

```

`f.tell()` returns an integer giving the file object’s current position in the file represented as number of bytes from the beginning of the file when in binary mode and an opaque number when in text mode.
To change the file object’s position, use `f.seek(offset, whence)`. The position is computed from adding _offset_ to a reference point; the reference point is selected by the _whence_ argument. A _whence_ value of 0 measures from the beginning of the file, 1 uses the current file position, and 2 uses the end of the file as the reference point. _whence_ can be omitted and defaults to 0, using the beginning of the file as the reference point.
Copy```
>>> f = open('workfile', 'rb+')
>>> f.write(b'0123456789abcdef')
16
>>> f.seek(5)      # Go to the 6th byte in the file
5
>>> f.read(1)
b'5'
>>> f.seek(-3, 2)  # Go to the 3rd byte before the end
13
>>> f.read(1)
b'd'

```

In text files (those opened without a `b` in the mode string), only seeks relative to the beginning of the file are allowed (the exception being seeking to the very file end with `seek(0, 2)`) and the only valid _offset_ values are those returned from the `f.tell()`, or zero. Any other _offset_ value produces undefined behaviour.
File objects have some additional methods, such as [`isatty()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.isatty "io.IOBase.isatty") and [`truncate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.truncate "io.IOBase.truncate") which are less frequently used; consult the Library Reference for a complete guide to file objects.
###  7.2.2. Saving structured data with [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json "json: Encode and decode the JSON format.")[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#saving-structured-data-with-json "Link to this heading")
Strings can easily be written to and read from a file. Numbers take a bit more effort, since the [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.read "io.TextIOBase.read") method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"), which takes a string like `'123'` and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated.
Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://json.org). The standard module called [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json "json: Encode and decode the JSON format.") can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string representations; this process is called _serializing_. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called _deserializing_. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a file or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.
Note
The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.
If you have an object `x`, you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code:
Copy```
>>> importjson
>>> x = [1, 'simple', 'list']
>>> json.dumps(x)
'[1, "simple", "list"]'

```

Another variant of the [`dumps()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps "json.dumps") function, called [`dump()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump "json.dump"), simply serializes the object to a [text file](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file). So if `f` is a [text file](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file) object opened for writing, we can do this:
Copy```
json.dump(x, f)

```

To decode the object again, if `f` is a [binary file](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-binary-file) or [text file](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file) object which has been opened for reading:
Copy```
x = json.load(f)

```

Note
JSON files must be encoded in UTF-8. Use `encoding="utf-8"` when opening JSON file as a [text file](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file) for both of reading and writing.
This simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances in JSON requires a bit of extra effort. The reference for the [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json "json: Encode and decode the JSON format.") module contains an explanation of this.
See also
[`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") - the pickle module
Contrary to [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-json), _pickle_ is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is specific to Python and cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages. It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker.

#  3. An Informal Introduction to Python[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#an-informal-introduction-to-python "Link to this heading")
In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts ([>>>](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-0) and […](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-...)): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
You can use the “Copy” button (it appears in the upper-right corner when hovering over or tapping a code example), which strips prompts and omits output, to copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter.
Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, `#`, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
Some examples:
Copy```
# this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."

```

##  3.1. Using Python as a Calculator[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator "Link to this heading")
Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, `>>>`. (It shouldn’t take long.)
###  3.1.1. Numbers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers "Link to this heading")
The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` can be used to perform arithmetic; parentheses (`()`) can be used for grouping. For example:
Copy```
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating-point number
1.6

```

The integer numbers (e.g. `2`, `4`, `20`) have type [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"), the ones with a fractional part (e.g. `5.0`, `1.6`) have type [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float"). We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
Division (`/`) always returns a float. To do [floor division](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-floor-division) and get an integer result you can use the `//` operator; to calculate the remainder you can use `%`:
Copy```
>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>>
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5
>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2
>>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
17

```

With Python, it is possible to use the `**` operator to calculate powers [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#id3):
Copy```
>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
25
>>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
128

```

The equal sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:
Copy```
>>> width = 20
>>> height = 5 * 9
>>> width * height
900

```

If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:
Copy```
>>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'n' is not defined

```

There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point:
Copy```
>>> 4 * 3.75 - 1
14.0

```

In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable `_`. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:
Copy```
>>> tax = 12.5 / 100
>>> price = 100.50
>>> price * tax
12.5625
>>> price + _
113.0625
>>> round(_, 2)
113.06

```

This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.
In addition to [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") and [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float"), Python supports other types of numbers, such as [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") and [`Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction "fractions.Fraction"). Python also has built-in support for [complex numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric), and uses the `j` or `J` suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. `3+5j`).
###  3.1.2. Text[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#text "Link to this heading")
Python can manipulate text (represented by type [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str"), so-called “strings”) as well as numbers. This includes characters “`!`”, words “`rabbit`”, names “`Paris`”, sentences “`Got your back.`”, etc. “`Yay! :)`”. They can be enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`) with the same result [[2]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#id4).
Copy```
>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
'spam eggs'
>>> "Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!"  # double quotes
'Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!'
>>> '1975'  # digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings
'1975'

```

To quote a quote, we need to “escape” it, by preceding it with `\`. Alternatively, we can use the other type of quotation marks:
Copy```
>>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
"doesn't"
>>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
"doesn't"
>>> '"Yes," they said.'
'"Yes," they said.'
>>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
'"Yes," they said.'
>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
'"Isn\'t," they said.'

```

In the Python shell, the string definition and output string can look different. The [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print") function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:
Copy```
>>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
>>> s  # without print(), special characters are included in the string
'First line.\nSecond line.'
>>> print(s)  # with print(), special characters are interpreted, so \n produces new line
First line.
Second line.

```

If you don’t want characters prefaced by `\` to be interpreted as special characters, you can use _raw strings_ by adding an `r` before the first quote:
Copy```
>>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
C:\some
ame
>>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
C:\some\name

```

There is one subtle aspect to raw strings: a raw string may not end in an odd number of `\` characters; see [the FAQ entry](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#faq-programming-raw-string-backslash) for more information and workarounds.
String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: `"""..."""` or `'''...'''`. End-of-line characters are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a `\` at the end of the line. In the following example, the initial newline is not included:
Copy```
>>> print("""\
... Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
...      -h                        Display this usage message
...      -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
... """)
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
     -h                        Display this usage message
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to

>>>

```

Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the `+` operator, and repeated with `*`:
Copy```
>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium'

```

Two or more _string literals_ (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.
Copy```
>>> 'Py' 'thon'
'Python'

```

This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:
Copy```
>>> text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
...         'to have them joined together.')
>>> text
'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'

```

This only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions:
Copy```
>>> prefix = 'Py'
>>> prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal
  File "<stdin>", line 1
prefix 'thon'
^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> ('un' * 3) 'ium'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
('un' * 3) 'ium'
^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

If you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use `+`:
Copy```
>>> prefix + 'thon'
'Python'

```

Strings can be _indexed_ (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:
Copy```
>>> word = 'Python'
>>> word[0]  # character in position 0
'P'
>>> word[5]  # character in position 5
'n'

```

Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:
Copy```
>>> word[-1]  # last character
'n'
>>> word[-2]  # second-last character
'o'
>>> word[-6]
'P'

```

Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.
In addition to indexing, _slicing_ is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, _slicing_ allows you to obtain a substring:
Copy```
>>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
'tho'

```

Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
Copy```
>>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
'on'
>>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
'on'

```

Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that `s[:i] + s[i:]` is always equal to `s`:
Copy```
>>> word[:2] + word[2:]
'Python'
>>> word[:4] + word[4:]
'Python'

```

One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing _between_ characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of _n_ characters has index _n_ , for example:
Copy```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1

```

The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0…6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from _i_ to _j_ consists of all characters between the edges labeled _i_ and _j_ , respectively.
For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the indices, if both are within bounds. For example, the length of `word[1:3]` is 2.
Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:
Copy```
>>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range

```

However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:
Copy```
>>> word[4:42]
'on'
>>> word[42:]
''

```

Python strings cannot be changed — they are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable). Therefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:
Copy```
>>> word[0] = 'J'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
>>> word[2:] = 'py'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

```

If you need a different string, you should create a new one:
Copy```
>>> 'J' + word[1:]
'Jython'
>>> word[:2] + 'py'
'Pypy'

```

The built-in function [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") returns the length of a string:
Copy```
>>> s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
>>> len(s)
34

```

###  3.1.3. Lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists "Link to this heading")
Python knows a number of _compound_ data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the _list_ , which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
Copy```
>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>> squares
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

Like strings (and all other built-in [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) types), lists can be indexed and sliced:
Copy```
>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
1
>>> squares[-1]
25
>>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
[9, 16, 25]

```

Lists also support operations like concatenation:
Copy```
>>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

```

Unlike strings, which are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), lists are a [mutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mutable) type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:
Copy```
>>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here
>>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
64
>>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
>>> cubes
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

```

You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the [`list.append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.append "list.append") _method_ (we will see more about methods later):
Copy```
>>> cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
>>> cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
>>> cubes
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]

```

Simple assignment in Python never copies data. When you assign a list to a variable, the variable refers to the _existing list_. Any changes you make to the list through one variable will be seen through all other variables that refer to it.:
Copy```
>>> rgb = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
>>> rgba = rgb
>>> id(rgb) == id(rgba)  # they reference the same object
True
>>> rgba.append("Alph")
>>> rgb
["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alph"]

```

All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a [shallow copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#shallow-vs-deep-copy) of the list:
Copy```
>>> correct_rgba = rgba[:]
>>> correct_rgba[-1] = "Alpha"
>>> correct_rgba
["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alpha"]
>>> rgba
["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alph"]

```

Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely:
Copy```
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
>>> letters
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
>>> # replace some values
>>> letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']
>>> letters
['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g']
>>> # now remove them
>>> letters[2:5] = []
>>> letters
['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']
>>> # clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list
>>> letters[:] = []
>>> letters
[]

```

The built-in function [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len "len") also applies to lists:
Copy```
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> len(letters)
4

```

It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for example:
Copy```
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> n = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x = [a, n]
>>> x
[['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]
>>> x[0]
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> x[0][1]
'b'

```

##  3.2. First Steps Towards Programming[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming "Link to this heading")
Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the [Fibonacci series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) as follows:
Copy```
>>> # Fibonacci series:
>>> # the sum of two elements defines the next
>>> a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 10:
...     print(a)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0
1
1
2
3
5
8

```

This example introduces several new features.
  * The first line contains a _multiple assignment_ : the variables `a` and `b` simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.
  * The [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) loop executes as long as the condition (here: `a < 10`) remains true. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `==` (equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to), `>=` (greater than or equal to) and `!=` (not equal to).
  * The _body_ of the loop is _indented_ : indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.
  * The [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print "print") function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments, floating-point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:
Copy```
>>> i = 256*256
>>> print('The value of i is', i)
The value of i is 65536

```

The keyword argument _end_ can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:
Copy```
>>> a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 1000:
...     print(a, end=',')
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,

```



Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#id1)]
Since `**` has higher precedence than `-`, `-3**2` will be interpreted as `-(3**2)` and thus result in `-9`. To avoid this and get `9`, you can use `(-3)**2`.
[[2](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#id2)]
Unlike other languages, special characters such as `\n` have the same meaning with both single (`'...'`) and double (`"..."`) quotes. The only difference between the two is that within single quotes you don’t need to escape `"` (but you have to escape `\'`) and vice versa.

#  12. Virtual Environments and Packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#virtual-environments-and-packages "Link to this heading")
##  12.1. Introduction[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#introduction "Link to this heading")
Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library’s interface.
This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.
The solution for this problem is to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-environment), a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.
Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements, application A can have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will not affect application A’s environment.
##  12.2. Creating Virtual Environments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments "Link to this heading")
The module used to create and manage virtual environments is called [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "venv: Creation of virtual environments."). [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "venv: Creation of virtual environments.") will install the Python version from which the command was run (as reported by the [`--version`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-version) option). For instance, executing the command with `python3.12` will install version 3.12.
To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "venv: Creation of virtual environments.") module as a script with the directory path:
Copy```
python -m venv tutorial-env

```

This will create the `tutorial-env` directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter and various supporting files.
A common directory location for a virtual environment is `.venv`. This name keeps the directory typically hidden in your shell and thus out of the way while giving it a name that explains why the directory exists. It also prevents clashing with `.env` environment variable definition files that some tooling supports.
Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
On Windows, run:
Copy```
tutorial-env\Scripts\activate

```

On Unix or MacOS, run:
Copy```
source tutorial-env/bin/activate

```

(This script is written for the bash shell. If you use the **csh** or **fish** shells, there are alternate `activate.csh` and `activate.fish` scripts you should use instead.)
Activating the virtual environment will change your shell’s prompt to show what virtual environment you’re using, and modify the environment so that running `python` will get you that particular version and installation of Python. For example:
```
source(tutorial-env)3.5.1(default,62016,10:59:36)
['','/usr/local/lib/python35.zip','~/envs/tutorial-env/lib/python3.5/site-packages']
>>>

```

To deactivate a virtual environment, type:
Copy```
deactivate

```

into the terminal.
##  12.3. Managing Packages with pip[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#managing-packages-with-pip "Link to this heading")
You can install, upgrade, and remove packages using a program called **pip**. By default `pip` will install packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org). You can browse the Python Package Index by going to it in your web browser.
`pip` has a number of subcommands: “install”, “uninstall”, “freeze”, etc. (Consult the [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-index) guide for complete documentation for `pip`.)
You can install the latest version of a package by specifying a package’s name:
```
(tutorial-env)(136kB)
Installingfor
```

You can also install a specific version of a package by giving the package name followed by `==` and the version number:
```
(tutorial-env)requests==2.6.0
Collectingrequests==2.6.0

```

If you re-run this command, `pip` will notice that the requested version is already installed and do nothing. You can supply a different version number to get that version, or you can run `python -m pip install --upgrade` to upgrade the package to the latest version:
```
(tutorial-env)2.6.0

```

`python -m pip uninstall` followed by one or more package names will remove the packages from the virtual environment.
`python -m pip show` will display information about a particular package:
```
(tutorial-env)2.0
Name:2.7.0
Summary:for2.0
Location:
```

`python -m pip list` will display all of the packages installed in the virtual environment:
```
(tutorial-env)(3.1.1.3)
numpy(1.9.2)
pip(7.0.3)
requests(2.7.0)
setuptools(16.0)

```

`python -m pip freeze` will produce a similar list of the installed packages, but the output uses the format that `python -m pip install` expects. A common convention is to put this list in a `requirements.txt` file:
```
(tutorial-env)(tutorial-env)novas==3.1.1.3
numpy==1.9.2
requests==2.7.0

```

The `requirements.txt` can then be committed to version control and shipped as part of an application. Users can then install all the necessary packages with `install -r`:
```
(tutorial-env)novas==3.1.1.3(from(line1))
numpy==1.9.2(from(line2))
requests==2.7.0(from(line3))
for
```

`pip` has many more options. Consult the [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-index) guide for complete documentation for `pip`. When you’ve written a package and want to make it available on the Python Package Index, consult the [Python packaging user guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

#  13. What Now?[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/whatnow.html#what-now "Link to this heading")
Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python — you should be eager to apply Python to solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?
This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:
  * [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index):
You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a _lot_ of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.
  * [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-index) explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.
  * [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index): A detailed explanation of Python’s syntax and semantics. It’s heavy reading, but is useful as a complete guide to the language itself.


More Python resources:
  * <https://www.python.org>: The major Python web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the web.
  * <https://docs.python.org>: Fast access to Python’s documentation.

#  6. Modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules "Link to this heading")
If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a _script_. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.
To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a _module_ ; definitions from a module can be _imported_ into other modules or into the _main_ module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called `fibo.py` in the current directory with the following contents:
Copy```
# Fibonacci numbers module

deffib(n):
"""Write Fibonacci series up to n."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

deffib2(n):
"""Return Fibonacci series up to n."""
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a+b
    return result

```

Now enter the Python interpreter and import this module with the following command:
Copy```
>>> importfibo

```

This does not add the names of the functions defined in `fibo` directly to the current [namespace](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace) (see [Python Scopes and Namespaces](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-scopes) for more details); it only adds the module name `fibo` there. Using the module name you can access the functions:
Copy```
>>> fibo.fib(1000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
>>> fibo.fib2(100)
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
>>> fibo.__name__
'fibo'

```

If you intend to use a function often you can assign it to a local name:
Copy```
>>> fib = fibo.fib
>>> fib(500)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

```

##  6.1. More on Modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#more-on-modules "Link to this heading")
A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions. These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the _first_ time the module name is encountered in an import statement. [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#id3) (They are also run if the file is executed as a script.)
Each module has its own private namespace, which is used as the global namespace by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, `modname.itemname`.
Modules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place all [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statements at the beginning of a module (or script, for that matter). The imported module names, if placed at the top level of a module (outside any functions or classes), are added to the module’s global namespace.
There is a variant of the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing module’s namespace. For example:
Copy```
>>> fromfiboimport fib, fib2
>>> fib(500)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

```

This does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken in the local namespace (so in the example, `fibo` is not defined).
There is even a variant to import all names that a module defines:
Copy```
>>> fromfiboimport *
>>> fib(500)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

```

This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (`_`). In most cases Python programmers do not use this facility since it introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding some things you have already defined.
Note that in general the practice of importing `*` from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often causes poorly readable code. However, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions.
If the module name is followed by `as`, then the name following `as` is bound directly to the imported module.
Copy```
>>> importfiboasfib
>>> fib.fib(500)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

```

This is effectively importing the module in the same way that `import fibo` will do, with the only difference of it being available as `fib`.
It can also be used when utilising [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#from) with similar effects:
Copy```
>>> fromfiboimport fib as fibonacci
>>> fibonacci(500)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

```

Note
For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session. Therefore, if you change your modules, you must restart the interpreter – or, if it’s just one module you want to test interactively, use [`importlib.reload()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload "importlib.reload"), e.g. `import importlib; importlib.reload(modulename)`.
###  6.1.1. Executing modules as scripts[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#executing-modules-as-scripts "Link to this heading")
When you run a Python module with
Copy```
python fibo.py <arguments>

```

the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the `__name__` set to `"__main__"`. That means that by adding this code at the end of your module:
Copy```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    importsys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))

```

you can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the module is executed as the “main” file:
```
$ python50
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

```

If the module is imported, the code is not run:
Copy```
>>> importfibo
>>>

```

This is often used either to provide a convenient user interface to a module, or for testing purposes (running the module as a script executes a test suite).
###  6.1.2. The Module Search Path[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path "Link to this heading")
When a module named `spam` is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. These module names are listed in [`sys.builtin_module_names`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.builtin_module_names "sys.builtin_module_names"). If not found, it then searches for a file named `spam.py` in a list of directories given by the variable [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"). [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") is initialized from these locations:
  * The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).
  * [`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable `PATH`).
  * The installation-dependent default (by convention including a `site-packages` directory, handled by the [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") module).


More details are at [The initialization of the sys.path module search path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys_path_init.html#sys-path-init).
Note
On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the directory containing the symlink is **not** added to the module search path.
After initialization, Python programs can modify [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"). The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended. See section [Standard Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-standardmodules) for more information.
###  6.1.3. “Compiled” Python files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#compiled-python-files "Link to this heading")
To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the `__pycache__` directory under the name `module._version_.pyc`, where the version encodes the format of the compiled file; it generally contains the Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of spam.py would be cached as`__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc`. This naming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions of Python to coexist.
Python checks the modification date of the source against the compiled version to see if it’s out of date and needs to be recompiled. This is a completely automatic process. Also, the compiled modules are platform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems with different architectures.
Python does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the result for the module that’s loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.
Some tips for experts:
  * You can use the [`-O`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O) or [`-OO`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-OO) switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module. The `-O` switch removes assert statements, the `-OO` switch removes both assert statements and __doc__ strings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you’re doing. “Optimized” modules have an `opt-` tag and are usually smaller. Future releases may change the effects of optimization.
  * A program doesn’t run any faster when it is read from a `.pyc` file than when it is read from a `.py` file; the only thing that’s faster about `.pyc` files is the speed with which they are loaded.
  * The module [`compileall`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html#module-compileall "compileall: Tools for byte-compiling all Python source files in a directory tree.") can create .pyc files for all modules in a directory.
  * There is more detail on this process, including a flow chart of the decisions, in [**PEP 3147**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3147/).


##  6.2. Standard Modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#standard-modules "Link to this heading")
Python comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate document, the Python Library Reference (“Library Reference” hereafter). Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls. The set of such modules is a configuration option which also depends on the underlying platform. For example, the [`winreg`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winreg.html#module-winreg "winreg: Routines and objects for manipulating the Windows registry. \(Windows\)") module is only provided on Windows systems. One particular module deserves some attention: [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions."), which is built into every Python interpreter. The variables `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` define the strings used as primary and secondary prompts:
Copy```
>>> importsys
>>> sys.ps1
'>>> '
>>> sys.ps2
'... '
>>> sys.ps1 = 'C> '
C> print('Yuck!')
Yuck!
C>

```

These two variables are only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode.
The variable `sys.path` is a list of strings that determines the interpreter’s search path for modules. It is initialized to a default path taken from the environment variable [`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH), or from a built-in default if [`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) is not set. You can modify it using standard list operations:
Copy```
>>> importsys
>>> sys.path.append('/ufs/guido/lib/python')

```

##  6.3. The [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") Function[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-dir-function "Link to this heading")
The built-in function [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") is used to find out which names a module defines. It returns a sorted list of strings:
Copy```
>>> importfibo,sys
>>> dir(fibo)
['__name__', 'fib', 'fib2']
>>> dir(sys)
['__breakpointhook__', '__displayhook__', '__doc__', '__excepthook__',
 '__interactivehook__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__',
 '__stderr__', '__stdin__', '__stdout__', '__unraisablehook__',
 '_clear_type_cache', '_current_frames', '_debugmallocstats', '_framework',
 '_getframe', '_git', '_home', '_xoptions', 'abiflags', 'addaudithook',
 'api_version', 'argv', 'audit', 'base_exec_prefix', 'base_prefix',
 'breakpointhook', 'builtin_module_names', 'byteorder', 'call_tracing',
 'callstats', 'copyright', 'displayhook', 'dont_write_bytecode', 'exc_info',
 'excepthook', 'exec_prefix', 'executable', 'exit', 'flags', 'float_info',

 'setprofile', 'setrecursionlimit', 'setswitchinterval', 'settrace', 'stderr',
 'stdin', 'stdout', 'thread_info', 'unraisablehook', 'version', 'version_info',
 'warnoptions']

```

Without arguments, [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") lists the names you have defined currently:
Copy```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> importfibo
>>> fib = fibo.fib
>>> dir()
['__builtins__', '__name__', 'a', 'fib', 'fibo', 'sys']

```

Note that it lists all types of names: variables, modules, functions, etc.
[`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") does not list the names of built-in functions and variables. If you want a list of those, they are defined in the standard module [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."):
Copy```
>>> importbuiltins
>>> dir(builtins)
['ArithmeticError', 'AssertionError', 'AttributeError', 'BaseException',
 'BlockingIOError', 'BrokenPipeError', 'BufferError', 'BytesWarning',
 'ChildProcessError', 'ConnectionAbortedError', 'ConnectionError',

 'zip']

```

##  6.4. Packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages "Link to this heading")
Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”. For example, the module name `A.B` designates a submodule named `B` in a package named `A`. Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other’s module names.
Suppose you want to design a collection of modules (a “package”) for the uniform handling of sound files and sound data. There are many different sound file formats (usually recognized by their extension, for example: `.wav`, `.aiff`, `.au`), so you may need to create and maintain a growing collection of modules for the conversion between the various file formats. There are also many different operations you might want to perform on sound data (such as mixing, adding echo, applying an equalizer function, creating an artificial stereo effect), so in addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to perform these operations. Here’s a possible structure for your package (expressed in terms of a hierarchical filesystem):
When importing the package, Python searches through the directories on `sys.path` looking for the package subdirectory.
The `__init__.py` files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages (unless using a [namespace package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace-package), a relatively advanced feature). This prevents directories with a common name, such as `string`, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, `__init__.py` can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the `__all__` variable, described later.
Users of the package can import individual modules from the package, for example:
Copy```
importsound.effects.echo

```

This loads the submodule `sound.effects.echo`. It must be referenced with its full name.
Copy```
sound.effects.echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)

```

An alternative way of importing the submodule is:
Copy```
fromsound.effectsimport echo

```

This also loads the submodule `echo`, and makes it available without its package prefix, so it can be used as follows:
Copy```
echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)

```

Yet another variation is to import the desired function or variable directly:
Copy```
fromsound.effects.echoimport echofilter

```

Again, this loads the submodule `echo`, but this makes its function `echofilter()` directly available:
Copy```
echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)

```

Note that when using `from package import item`, the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable. The `import` statement first tests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") exception is raised.
Contrarily, when using syntax like `import item.subitem.subsubitem`, each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.
###  6.4.1. Importing * From a Package[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package "Link to this heading")
Now what happens when the user writes `from sound.effects import *`? Ideally, one would hope that this somehow goes out to the filesystem, finds which submodules are present in the package, and imports them all. This could take a long time and importing sub-modules might have unwanted side-effects that should only happen when the sub-module is explicitly imported.
The only solution is for the package author to provide an explicit index of the package. The [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement uses the following convention: if a package’s `__init__.py` code defines a list named `__all__`, it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when `from package import *` is encountered. It is up to the package author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the package is released. Package authors may also decide not to support it, if they don’t see a use for importing * from their package. For example, the file `sound/effects/__init__.py` could contain the following code:
Copy```
__all__ = ["echo", "surround", "reverse"]

```

This would mean that `from sound.effects import *` would import the three named submodules of the `sound.effects` package.
Be aware that submodules might become shadowed by locally defined names. For example, if you added a `reverse` function to the `sound/effects/__init__.py` file, the `from sound.effects import *` would only import the two submodules `echo` and `surround`, but _not_ the `reverse` submodule, because it is shadowed by the locally defined `reverse` function:
Copy```
__all__ = [
    "echo",      # refers to the 'echo.py' file
    "surround",  # refers to the 'surround.py' file
    "reverse",   # !!! refers to the 'reverse' function now !!!
]

defreverse(msg: str):  # <-- this name shadows the 'reverse.py' submodule
    return msg[::-1]    #     in the case of a 'from sound.effects import *'

```

If `__all__` is not defined, the statement `from sound.effects import *` does _not_ import all submodules from the package `sound.effects` into the current namespace; it only ensures that the package `sound.effects` has been imported (possibly running any initialization code in `__init__.py`) and then imports whatever names are defined in the package. This includes any names defined (and submodules explicitly loaded) by `__init__.py`. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previous [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statements. Consider this code:
Copy```
importsound.effects.echo
importsound.effects.surround
fromsound.effectsimport *

```

In this example, the `echo` and `surround` modules are imported in the current namespace because they are defined in the `sound.effects` package when the `from...import` statement is executed. (This also works when `__all__` is defined.)
Although certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use `import *`, it is still considered bad practice in production code.
Remember, there is nothing wrong with using `from package import specific_submodule`! In fact, this is the recommended notation unless the importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from different packages.
###  6.4.2. Intra-package References[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references "Link to this heading")
When packages are structured into subpackages (as with the `sound` package in the example), you can use absolute imports to refer to submodules of siblings packages. For example, if the module `sound.filters.vocoder` needs to use the `echo` module in the `sound.effects` package, it can use `from sound.effects import echo`.
You can also write relative imports, with the `from module import name` form of import statement. These imports use leading dots to indicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative import. From the `surround` module for example, you might use:
Copy```
from.import echo
from..import formats
from..filtersimport equalizer

```

Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module’s package. Since the main module does not have a package, modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.
###  6.4.3. Packages in Multiple Directories[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages-in-multiple-directories "Link to this heading")
Packages support one more special attribute, [`__path__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#module.__path__ "module.__path__"). This is initialized to be a [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) of strings containing the name of the directory holding the package’s `__init__.py` before the code in that file is executed. This variable can be modified; doing so affects future searches for modules and subpackages contained in the package.
While this feature is not often needed, it can be used to extend the set of modules found in a package.
Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#id1)]
In fact function definitions are also ‘statements’ that are ‘executed’; the execution of a module-level function definition adds the function name to the module’s global namespace.

#  11. Brief Tour of the Standard Library — Part II[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#brief-tour-of-the-standard-library-part-ii "Link to this heading")
This second tour covers more advanced modules that support professional programming needs. These modules rarely occur in small scripts.
##  11.1. Output Formatting[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#output-formatting "Link to this heading")
The [`reprlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/reprlib.html#module-reprlib "reprlib: Alternate repr\(\) implementation with size limits.") module provides a version of [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") customized for abbreviated displays of large or deeply nested containers:
Copy```
>>> importreprlib
>>> reprlib.repr(set('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'))
"{'a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', ...}"

```

The [`pprint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html#module-pprint "pprint: Data pretty printer.") module offers more sophisticated control over printing both built-in and user defined objects in a way that is readable by the interpreter. When the result is longer than one line, the “pretty printer” adds line breaks and indentation to more clearly reveal data structure:
Copy```
>>> importpprint
>>> t = [[[['black', 'cyan'], 'white', ['green', 'red']], [['magenta',
...     'yellow'], 'blue']]]
...
>>> pprint.pprint(t, width=30)
[[[['black', 'cyan'],
   'white',
   ['green', 'red']],
  [['magenta', 'yellow'],
   'blue']]]

```

The [`textwrap`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#module-textwrap "textwrap: Text wrapping and filling") module formats paragraphs of text to fit a given screen width:
Copy```
>>> importtextwrap
>>> doc = """The wrap() method is just like fill() except that it returns
... a list of strings instead of one big string with newlines to separate
... the wrapped lines."""
...
>>> print(textwrap.fill(doc, width=40))
The wrap() method is just like fill()
except that it returns a list of strings
instead of one big string with newlines
to separate the wrapped lines.

```

The [`locale`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#module-locale "locale: Internationalization services.") module accesses a database of culture specific data formats. The grouping attribute of locale’s format function provides a direct way of formatting numbers with group separators:
Copy```
>>> importlocale
>>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'English_United States.1252')
'English_United States.1252'
>>> conv = locale.localeconv()          # get a mapping of conventions
>>> x = 1234567.8
>>> locale.format_string("%d", x, grouping=True)
'1,234,567'
>>> locale.format_string("%s%.*f", (conv['currency_symbol'],
...                      conv['frac_digits'], x), grouping=True)
'$1,234,567.80'

```

##  11.2. Templating[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#templating "Link to this heading")
The [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations.") module includes a versatile [`Template`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template "string.Template") class with a simplified syntax suitable for editing by end-users. This allows users to customize their applications without having to alter the application.
The format uses placeholder names formed by `$` with valid Python identifiers (alphanumeric characters and underscores). Surrounding the placeholder with braces allows it to be followed by more alphanumeric letters with no intervening spaces. Writing `$$` creates a single escaped `$`:
Copy```
>>> fromstringimport Template
>>> t = Template('${village}folk send $$10 to $cause.')
>>> t.substitute(village='Nottingham', cause='the ditch fund')
'Nottinghamfolk send $10 to the ditch fund.'

```

The [`substitute()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template.substitute "string.Template.substitute") method raises a [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "KeyError") when a placeholder is not supplied in a dictionary or a keyword argument. For mail-merge style applications, user supplied data may be incomplete and the [`safe_substitute()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template.safe_substitute "string.Template.safe_substitute") method may be more appropriate — it will leave placeholders unchanged if data is missing:
Copy```
>>> t = Template('Return the $item to $owner.')
>>> d = dict(item='unladen swallow')
>>> t.substitute(d)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 'owner'
>>> t.safe_substitute(d)
'Return the unladen swallow to $owner.'

```

Template subclasses can specify a custom delimiter. For example, a batch renaming utility for a photo browser may elect to use percent signs for placeholders such as the current date, image sequence number, or file format:
Copy```
>>> importtime,os.path
>>> photofiles = ['img_1074.jpg', 'img_1076.jpg', 'img_1077.jpg']
>>> classBatchRename(Template):
...     delimiter = '%'
...
>>> fmt = input('Enter rename style (%d-date %n-seqnum %f-format):  ')
Enter rename style (%d-date %n-seqnum %f-format):  Ashley_%n%f

>>> t = BatchRename(fmt)
>>> date = time.strftime('%d%b%y')
>>> for i, filename in enumerate(photofiles):
...     base, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
...     newname = t.substitute(d=date, n=i, f=ext)
...     print('{0} --> {1}'.format(filename, newname))

img_1074.jpg --> Ashley_0.jpg
img_1076.jpg --> Ashley_1.jpg
img_1077.jpg --> Ashley_2.jpg

```

Another application for templating is separating program logic from the details of multiple output formats. This makes it possible to substitute custom templates for XML files, plain text reports, and HTML web reports.
##  11.3. Working with Binary Data Record Layouts[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#working-with-binary-data-record-layouts "Link to this heading")
The [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#module-struct "struct: Interpret bytes as packed binary data.") module provides [`pack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack "struct.pack") and [`unpack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.unpack "struct.unpack") functions for working with variable length binary record formats. The following example shows how to loop through header information in a ZIP file without using the [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.") module. Pack codes `"H"` and `"I"` represent two and four byte unsigned numbers respectively. The `"<"` indicates that they are standard size and in little-endian byte order:
Copy```
importstruct

with open('myfile.zip', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

start = 0
for i in range(3):                      # show the first 3 file headers
    start += 14
    fields = struct.unpack('<IIIHH', data[start:start+16])
    crc32, comp_size, uncomp_size, filenamesize, extra_size = fields

    start += 16
    filename = data[start:start+filenamesize]
    start += filenamesize
    extra = data[start:start+extra_size]
    print(filename, hex(crc32), comp_size, uncomp_size)

    start += extra_size + comp_size     # skip to the next header

```

##  11.4. Multi-threading[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#multi-threading "Link to this heading")
Threading is a technique for decoupling tasks which are not sequentially dependent. Threads can be used to improve the responsiveness of applications that accept user input while other tasks run in the background. A related use case is running I/O in parallel with computations in another thread.
The following code shows how the high level [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module can run tasks in background while the main program continues to run:
Copy```
importthreading,zipfile

classAsyncZip(threading.Thread):
    def__init__(self, infile, outfile):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.infile = infile
        self.outfile = outfile

    defrun(self):
        f = zipfile.ZipFile(self.outfile, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
        f.write(self.infile)
        f.close()
        print('Finished background zip of:', self.infile)

background = AsyncZip('mydata.txt', 'myarchive.zip')
background.start()
print('The main program continues to run in foreground.')

background.join()    # Wait for the background task to finish
print('Main program waited until background was done.')

```

The principal challenge of multi-threaded applications is coordinating threads that share data or other resources. To that end, the threading module provides a number of synchronization primitives including locks, events, condition variables, and semaphores.
While those tools are powerful, minor design errors can result in problems that are difficult to reproduce. So, the preferred approach to task coordination is to concentrate all access to a resource in a single thread and then use the [`queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.") module to feed that thread with requests from other threads. Applications using [`Queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") objects for inter-thread communication and coordination are easier to design, more readable, and more reliable.
##  11.5. Logging[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#logging "Link to this heading")
The [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") module offers a full featured and flexible logging system. At its simplest, log messages are sent to a file or to `sys.stderr`:
Copy```
importlogging
logging.debug('Debugging information')
logging.info('Informational message')
logging.warning('Warning:config file %s not found', 'server.conf')
logging.error('Error occurred')
logging.critical('Critical error -- shutting down')

```

This produces the following output:
By default, informational and debugging messages are suppressed and the output is sent to standard error. Other output options include routing messages through email, datagrams, sockets, or to an HTTP Server. New filters can select different routing based on message priority: [`DEBUG`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.DEBUG "logging.DEBUG"), [`INFO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.INFO "logging.INFO"), [`WARNING`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.WARNING "logging.WARNING"), [`ERROR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.ERROR "logging.ERROR"), and [`CRITICAL`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.CRITICAL "logging.CRITICAL").
The logging system can be configured directly from Python or can be loaded from a user editable configuration file for customized logging without altering the application.
##  11.6. Weak References[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#weak-references "Link to this heading")
Python does automatic memory management (reference counting for most objects and [garbage collection](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-garbage-collection) to eliminate cycles). The memory is freed shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated.
This approach works fine for most applications but occasionally there is a need to track objects only as long as they are being used by something else. Unfortunately, just tracking them creates a reference that makes them permanent. The [`weakref`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#module-weakref "weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries.") module provides tools for tracking objects without creating a reference. When the object is no longer needed, it is automatically removed from a weakref table and a callback is triggered for weakref objects. Typical applications include caching objects that are expensive to create:
Copy```
>>> importweakref,gc
>>> classA:
...     def__init__(self, value):
...         self.value = value
...     def__repr__(self):
...         return str(self.value)
...
>>> a = A(10)                   # create a reference
>>> d = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
>>> d['primary'] = a            # does not create a reference
>>> d['primary']                # fetch the object if it is still alive
10
>>> del a                       # remove the one reference
>>> gc.collect()                # run garbage collection right away
0
>>> d['primary']                # entry was automatically removed
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
d['primary']                # entry was automatically removed
  File "C:/python313/lib/weakref.py", line 46, in __getitem__
o = self.data[key]()
KeyError: 'primary'

##  11.7. Tools for Working with Lists[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#tools-for-working-with-lists "Link to this heading")
Many data structure needs can be met with the built-in list type. However, sometimes there is a need for alternative implementations with different performance trade-offs.
The [`array`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.") module provides an [`array`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#array.array "array.array") object that is like a list that stores only homogeneous data and stores it more compactly. The following example shows an array of numbers stored as two byte unsigned binary numbers (typecode `"H"`) rather than the usual 16 bytes per entry for regular lists of Python int objects:
Copy```
>>> fromarrayimport array
>>> a = array('H', [4000, 10, 700, 22222])
>>> sum(a)
26932
>>> a[1:3]
array('H', [10, 700])

```

The [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") module provides a [`deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque") object that is like a list with faster appends and pops from the left side but slower lookups in the middle. These objects are well suited for implementing queues and breadth first tree searches:
Copy```
>>> fromcollectionsimport deque
>>> d = deque(["task1", "task2", "task3"])
>>> d.append("task4")
>>> print("Handling", d.popleft())
Handling task1

```

Copy```
unsearched = deque([starting_node])
defbreadth_first_search(unsearched):
    node = unsearched.popleft()
    for m in gen_moves(node):
        if is_goal(m):
            return m
        unsearched.append(m)

```

In addition to alternative list implementations, the library also offers other tools such as the [`bisect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#module-bisect "bisect: Array bisection algorithms for binary searching.") module with functions for manipulating sorted lists:
Copy```
>>> importbisect
>>> scores = [(100, 'perl'), (200, 'tcl'), (400, 'lua'), (500, 'python')]
>>> bisect.insort(scores, (300, 'ruby'))
>>> scores
[(100, 'perl'), (200, 'tcl'), (300, 'ruby'), (400, 'lua'), (500, 'python')]

```

The [`heapq`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html#module-heapq "heapq: Heap queue algorithm \(a.k.a. priority queue\).") module provides functions for implementing heaps based on regular lists. The lowest valued entry is always kept at position zero. This is useful for applications which repeatedly access the smallest element but do not want to run a full list sort:
Copy```
>>> fromheapqimport heapify, heappop, heappush
>>> data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
>>> heapify(data)                      # rearrange the list into heap order
>>> heappush(data, -5)                 # add a new entry
>>> [heappop(data) for i in range(3)]  # fetch the three smallest entries
[-5, 0, 1]

```

##  11.8. Decimal Floating-Point Arithmetic[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#decimal-floating-point-arithmetic "Link to this heading")
The [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.") module offers a [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") datatype for decimal floating-point arithmetic. Compared to the built-in [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float") implementation of binary floating point, the class is especially helpful for
  * financial applications and other uses which require exact decimal representation,
  * control over precision,
  * control over rounding to meet legal or regulatory requirements,
  * tracking of significant decimal places, or
  * applications where the user expects the results to match calculations done by hand.


For example, calculating a 5% tax on a 70 cent phone charge gives different results in decimal floating point and binary floating point. The difference becomes significant if the results are rounded to the nearest cent:
Copy```
>>> fromdecimalimport *
>>> round(Decimal('0.70') * Decimal('1.05'), 2)
Decimal('0.74')
>>> round(.70 * 1.05, 2)
0.73

```

The [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") result keeps a trailing zero, automatically inferring four place significance from multiplicands with two place significance. Decimal reproduces mathematics as done by hand and avoids issues that can arise when binary floating point cannot exactly represent decimal quantities.
Exact representation enables the [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") class to perform modulo calculations and equality tests that are unsuitable for binary floating point:
Copy```
>>> Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('.10')
Decimal('0.00')
>>> 1.00 % 0.10
0.09999999999999995

>>> sum([Decimal('0.1')]*10) == Decimal('1.0')
True
>>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 1.0
False

```

The [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.") module provides arithmetic with as much precision as needed:
Copy```
>>> getcontext().prec = 36
>>> Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)
Decimal('0.142857142857142857142857142857142857')

```

#  10. Brief Tour of the Standard Library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#brief-tour-of-the-standard-library "Link to this heading")
##  10.1. Operating System Interface[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#operating-system-interface "Link to this heading")
The [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.") module provides dozens of functions for interacting with the operating system:
Copy```
>>> importos
>>> os.getcwd()      # Return the current working directory
'C:\\Python313'
>>> os.chdir('/server/accesslogs')   # Change current working directory
>>> os.system('mkdir today')   # Run the command mkdir in the system shell
0

```

Be sure to use the `import os` style instead of `from os import *`. This will keep [`os.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open "os.open") from shadowing the built-in [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") function which operates much differently.
The built-in [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") and [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help "help") functions are useful as interactive aids for working with large modules like [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces."):
Copy```
>>> importos
>>> dir(os)
<returns a list of all module functions>
>>> help(os)
<returns an extensive manual page created from the module's docstrings>

```

For daily file and directory management tasks, the [`shutil`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying.") module provides a higher level interface that is easier to use:
Copy```
>>> importshutil
>>> shutil.copyfile('data.db', 'archive.db')
'archive.db'
>>> shutil.move('/build/executables', 'installdir')
'installdir'

```

##  10.2. File Wildcards[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#file-wildcards "Link to this heading")
The [`glob`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#module-glob "glob: Unix shell style pathname pattern expansion.") module provides a function for making file lists from directory wildcard searches:
Copy```
>>> importglob
>>> glob.glob('*.py')
['primes.py', 'random.py', 'quote.py']

```

##  10.3. Command Line Arguments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments "Link to this heading")
Common utility scripts often need to process command line arguments. These arguments are stored in the [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") module’s _argv_ attribute as a list. For instance, let’s take the following `demo.py` file:
Copy```
# File demo.py
importsys
print(sys.argv)

```

Here is the output from running `python demo.py one two three` at the command line:
Copy```
['demo.py', 'one', 'two', 'three']

```

The [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library.") module provides a more sophisticated mechanism to process command line arguments. The following script extracts one or more filenames and an optional number of lines to be displayed:
Copy```
importargparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    prog='top',
    description='Show top lines from each file')
parser.add_argument('filenames', nargs='+')
parser.add_argument('-l', '--lines', type=int, default=10)
args = parser.parse_args()
print(args)

```

When run at the command line with `python top.py --lines=5 alpha.txt beta.txt`, the script sets `args.lines` to `5` and `args.filenames` to `['alpha.txt', 'beta.txt']`.
##  10.4. Error Output Redirection and Program Termination[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#error-output-redirection-and-program-termination "Link to this heading")
The [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") module also has attributes for _stdin_ , _stdout_ , and _stderr_. The latter is useful for emitting warnings and error messages to make them visible even when _stdout_ has been redirected:
Copy```
>>> sys.stderr.write('Warning, log file not found starting a new one\n')
Warning, log file not found starting a new one

```

The most direct way to terminate a script is to use `sys.exit()`.
##  10.5. String Pattern Matching[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#string-pattern-matching "Link to this heading")
The [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") module provides regular expression tools for advanced string processing. For complex matching and manipulation, regular expressions offer succinct, optimized solutions:
Copy```
>>> importre
>>> re.findall(r'\bf[a-z]*', 'which foot or hand fell fastest')
['foot', 'fell', 'fastest']
>>> re.sub(r'(\b[a-z]+) \1', r'\1', 'cat in the the hat')
'cat in the hat'

```

When only simple capabilities are needed, string methods are preferred because they are easier to read and debug:
Copy```
>>> 'tea for too'.replace('too', 'two')
'tea for two'

```

##  10.6. Mathematics[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#mathematics "Link to this heading")
The [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math "math: Mathematical functions \(sin\(\) etc.\).") module gives access to the underlying C library functions for floating-point math:
Copy```
>>> importmath
>>> math.cos(math.pi / 4)
0.70710678118654757
>>> math.log(1024, 2)
10.0

```

The [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random "random: Generate pseudo-random numbers with various common distributions.") module provides tools for making random selections:
Copy```
>>> importrandom
>>> random.choice(['apple', 'pear', 'banana'])
'apple'
>>> random.sample(range(100), 10)   # sampling without replacement
[30, 83, 16, 4, 8, 81, 41, 50, 18, 33]
>>> random.random()    # random float from the interval [0.0, 1.0)
0.17970987693706186
>>> random.randrange(6)    # random integer chosen from range(6)
4

```

The [`statistics`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#module-statistics "statistics: Mathematical statistics functions") module calculates basic statistical properties (the mean, median, variance, etc.) of numeric data:
Copy```
>>> importstatistics
>>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]
>>> statistics.mean(data)
1.6071428571428572
>>> statistics.median(data)
1.25
>>> statistics.variance(data)
1.3720238095238095

```

The SciPy project <<https://scipy.org>> has many other modules for numerical computations.
##  10.7. Internet Access[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#internet-access "Link to this heading")
There are a number of modules for accessing the internet and processing internet protocols. Two of the simplest are [`urllib.request`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request "urllib.request: Extensible library for opening URLs.") for retrieving data from URLs and [`smtplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib "smtplib: SMTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") for sending mail:
Copy```
>>> fromurllib.requestimport urlopen
>>> with urlopen('http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/etc/UTC.txt') as response:
...     for line in response:
...         line = line.decode()             # Convert bytes to a str
...         if line.startswith('datetime'):
...             print(line.rstrip())         # Remove trailing newline
...
datetime: 2022-01-01T01:36:47.689215+00:00

>>> importsmtplib
>>> server = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
>>> server.sendmail('soothsayer@example.org', 'jcaesar@example.org',
... """To: jcaesar@example.org
... From: soothsayer@example.org
...
... Beware the Ides of March.
... """)
>>> server.quit()

```

(Note that the second example needs a mailserver running on localhost.)
##  10.8. Dates and Times[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#dates-and-times "Link to this heading")
The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime "datetime: Basic date and time types.") module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient member extraction for output formatting and manipulation. The module also supports objects that are timezone aware.
Copy```
>>> # dates are easily constructed and formatted
>>> fromdatetimeimport date
>>> now = date.today()
>>> now
datetime.date(2003, 12, 2)
>>> now.strftime("%m-%d-%y. %d %b %Y is a %A on the %d day of %B.")
'12-02-03. 02 Dec 2003 is a Tuesday on the 02 day of December.'

>>> # dates support calendar arithmetic
>>> birthday = date(1964, 7, 31)
>>> age = now - birthday
>>> age.days
14368

```

##  10.9. Data Compression[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#data-compression "Link to this heading")
Common data archiving and compression formats are directly supported by modules including: [`zlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip."), [`gzip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects."), [`bz2`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#module-bz2 "bz2: Interfaces for bzip2 compression and decompression."), [`lzma`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library."), [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.") and [`tarfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files.").
Copy```
>>> importzlib
>>> s = b'witch which has which witches wrist watch'
>>> len(s)
41
>>> t = zlib.compress(s)
>>> len(t)
37
>>> zlib.decompress(t)
b'witch which has which witches wrist watch'
>>> zlib.crc32(s)
226805979

```

##  10.10. Performance Measurement[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#performance-measurement "Link to this heading")
Some Python users develop a deep interest in knowing the relative performance of different approaches to the same problem. Python provides a measurement tool that answers those questions immediately.
For example, it may be tempting to use the tuple packing and unpacking feature instead of the traditional approach to swapping arguments. The [`timeit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#module-timeit "timeit: Measure the execution time of small code snippets.") module quickly demonstrates a modest performance advantage:
Copy```
>>> fromtimeitimport Timer
>>> Timer('t=a; a=b; b=t', 'a=1; b=2').timeit()
0.57535828626024577
>>> Timer('a,b = b,a', 'a=1; b=2').timeit()
0.54962537085770791

```

In contrast to [`timeit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#module-timeit "timeit: Measure the execution time of small code snippets.")’s fine level of granularity, the [`profile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-profile "profile: Python source profiler.") and [`pstats`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-pstats "pstats: Statistics object for use with the profiler.") modules provide tools for identifying time critical sections in larger blocks of code.
##  10.11. Quality Control[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#quality-control "Link to this heading")
One approach for developing high quality software is to write tests for each function as it is developed and to run those tests frequently during the development process.
The [`doctest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") module provides a tool for scanning a module and validating tests embedded in a program’s docstrings. Test construction is as simple as cutting-and-pasting a typical call along with its results into the docstring. This improves the documentation by providing the user with an example and it allows the doctest module to make sure the code remains true to the documentation:
Copy```
defaverage(values):
"""Computes the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.

    >>> print(average([20, 30, 70]))
    40.0
    """
    return sum(values) / len(values)

importdoctest
doctest.testmod()   # automatically validate the embedded tests

```

The [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") module is not as effortless as the [`doctest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") module, but it allows a more comprehensive set of tests to be maintained in a separate file:
Copy```
importunittest

classTestStatisticalFunctions(unittest.TestCase):

    deftest_average(self):
        self.assertEqual(average([20, 30, 70]), 40.0)
        self.assertEqual(round(average([1, 5, 7]), 1), 4.3)
        with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
            average([])
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            average(20, 30, 70)

unittest.main()  # Calling from the command line invokes all tests

```

##  10.12. Batteries Included[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included "Link to this heading")
Python has a “batteries included” philosophy. This is best seen through the sophisticated and robust capabilities of its larger packages. For example:
  * The [`xmlrpc.client`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.client.html#module-xmlrpc.client "xmlrpc.client: XML-RPC client access.") and [`xmlrpc.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.html#module-xmlrpc.server "xmlrpc.server: Basic XML-RPC server implementations.") modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task. Despite the modules’ names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.
  * The [`email`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages.") package is a library for managing email messages, including MIME and other [**RFC 2822**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html)-based message documents. Unlike [`smtplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib "smtplib: SMTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") and [`poplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/poplib.html#module-poplib "poplib: POP3 protocol client \(requires sockets\).") which actually send and receive messages, the email package has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures (including attachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header protocols.
  * The [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json "json: Encode and decode the JSON format.") package provides robust support for parsing this popular data interchange format. The [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv "csv: Write and read tabular data to and from delimited files.") module supports direct reading and writing of files in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly supported by databases and spreadsheets. XML processing is supported by the [`xml.etree.ElementTree`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#module-xml.etree.ElementTree "xml.etree.ElementTree: Implementation of the ElementTree API."), [`xml.dom`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.html#module-xml.dom "xml.dom: Document Object Model API for Python.") and [`xml.sax`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.html#module-xml.sax "xml.sax: Package containing SAX2 base classes and convenience functions.") packages. Together, these modules and packages greatly simplify data interchange between Python applications and other tools.
  * The [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") module is a wrapper for the SQLite database library, providing a persistent database that can be updated and accessed using slightly nonstandard SQL syntax.
  * Internationalization is supported by a number of modules including [`gettext`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services."), [`locale`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#module-locale "locale: Internationalization services."), and the [`codecs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams.") package.
